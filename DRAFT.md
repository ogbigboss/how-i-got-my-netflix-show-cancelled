> "In intelligence work, surveillance is called coverage. It's like basketball; you can run zone defense or man-to-man. Man-to-man is risky; follow someone too long and they're going to get suspicious. Zone is usually the way to go. Stay put and let targets come to you. Less obvious, easier on the feet... and you can catch up on your celebrity gossip." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

_Late July 2022_

After a few years, most of us who lived in a big city like New York form a way to confirm their paranoias about whether or not that weird person who's been walking behind them is indeed _following_ them. One of my tricks, like many, is to pull out a cell phone or something to futz with, pause walking to begin futzing, and wait for the person to (hopefully) keep walking past.

The creepy short brown haired girl in the red dress who was just a little too *close* to me not only walked past, but as I began to walk forward, she seemed to look back at me with a coy glance before turning into the park on Essex st. before Canal as I was walking back to my South St. apartment in the Lower East Side.

My mind flashed back to March, when I was suspicious of the federal government being suspicious of me being a spy because of a mishap due to audio surveillance while working from home for a tech company. Way over the top, unrealistic flirting seemed like a fair play entrapment tactic, but that was March, during the first federal investigation, and this was July, after the second federal investigation went awry (for the feds), and in both cases, I looked like a hot mess - mostly on purpose, flirting while under fear of entrapment seemed unejoyable, but also, I am a man.

Anyway, why would the feds try the first trick that didn't work the first time again months later?

As the creepy short brown haired girl in the red dress walked into the park, she took a second to glance further down to the corner of Essex st. by the benches. I saw in that direction a collection of young men, at least 4 or 5, all wearing the same clean white t shirt, and similar pants. While I assumed they could be connected, I couldn't imagine why the feds would dress up a bunch of young men in a psuedo clockwork orange outfit, and I also remembered there was a small playhouse up the street behind me on Grand. Maybe they were in a staged version of clockwork orange?

But why, from about 50 ft away, did it feel like they were all shoulders pointed in my direction, looking at me or the girl?

New Yorkers and those from other dense cities also have a way of figuring out if that gang of men are oggling you in a threatening way down the street or not -- my favorite is crossing the street to see if they follow.

Two men begin to cross, and purposelly eye me the whole time. I wait til we're about 15 feet apart and on the same side of Essex st to look up.

The man on the left was very pretty and had pectoral muscles that would look great in a photo but revealed little in terms of atheltic prowess other than that the guy bench presses, and probably had that day. He also had a very clean haircut with a middle part. He walked with a wide swagger which was either meant to intimidate as he was staring me down, or was a tip that he was a west coaster.

To his right was a shorter, nerdier looking man whom I had identified in early June as part of the second federal investigation at the second tech company I worked for that year whom I had nicknamed "Tevas" to those listening to me under audio surveillance, largely as a way to make fun of him for being the only tech guy amongst a crowd of law enforcement employees, public and private. I knew it'd hurt his feelings at the time if I made fun of his open toed sandals that most New Yorkers just... wouldn't.

Tevas looked at me, open mouthed, with a face that I believe was meant to intimidate but only revealed his own fear of losing social face in a situation involving me, again.

He had changed out of his Tevas and was now wearing combat boots.

Sending some kids from the west coast to make me feel scared was... something certainly, but I couldn't imagine why the Federal Government would think that would work after normative bogus investigation tactics didn't.

What, were they TV producers or something?

I took a large, _Arrested Development_-with-the-_Charlie Brown_-music-in-the-background sigh on the corner of Canal and Essex, directly across from the remains of the white shirt gang. I got a chicken sandwich, then on the walk home up Canal, I saw the creepy brunette ina red dress again, she made a point to look at me with a big frown, as though I had just disappointed her. I tried giving her a "what the fuck is wrong with you" look, and walked home, where I chastised those potentially audio surveilling me for sexism in operational tactics.

Given everything that happened in the past few months, along with the Federal Government denying the right to abortion despite trying to pass a law codifying it, it seemed like the right move. And just in case I was right about the TV producer thing, in the back of my mind, I remembered the large collection of stolen and bootleg DVDs I had in my closet.

> "One of the dangers of any kind of psychological warfare, is it can be too effective, and send the target into a paranoid tail-spin. That paranoia can be useful... or deadly." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

_Late January 2022_

Getting Microsoft's Blue Screen of Death in a Windows 10 install is rare, but possible, and like the board game _Clue_, was arguably more popular in the past. The Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD, is a rare computer-halting error state that will force you to turn off your machine, lest you wish to stare at a blue screen with an error message, hence the name. Similar to _Clue_, Microsoft's BSOD involves three things: your active OS thread has been murdered, in the stack trace, by, generally speaking, the weapon of shoddy programming.

Like I said, it doesn't happen as often these days, but the rules haven't changed: some program you were running on your computer caused the BSOD, they don't just happen.

So, just like in _Clue_, you have three distinct facts that add up to one question: who done it?

On January 28 2022 (nts: check, was a friday), after accepting an offer in principal from Vouch inc, the only thing I was doing on my windows machine at the time was looking at a PDF of their business basics in a single chrome tab running Gmail's preview of the PDF.

Earlier that day I had what felt like an odd communication around the background check after accepting the offer. I immediately assumed the company was "looking into" my machine -- they may have found it odd that in my interviews I used my Apple Macbook, and had suddenly used a Windows machine to open an email, perhaps, though that has more to do with my Macbook being portable for more suitable webcam angles than my Windows machine, a desktop, can offer given it's position opposite to my framed covers of weird comic books.

Anyway, such tactics would be odd for a business insurance company to use from a black hat perspective -- I assumed at that point they or the background check company perhaps had a connection with the Federal Government whom would be more equipped for such hacking, even if it mistakenly led to a BSOD (admittedly, I don't often upgrade my windows machine, so it may have been a version conflict with their malware, but I digress).

There's only so many ways to "talk" to the Feds (or any extended network of surveillance and/or security they may be connected to within private spheres) if they're looking into you in ways that may have not involved a court order, at least digitally. Knowing, or at least hoping, my internet connection was being tracked if not my desktop machine itself, I restarted my machine and made some fecitious web requests in my browser, things that definitely didn't have DNS entries, like, but not limited to:

```
https://look-im-not-here-to-do-anything-weird-im-just-here-for-the-equity.com/
https://do-what-you-need-i-get-it-but-lets-not-be-weird-ok.com/
https://that-said-please-dont-mess-up-my-games-or-music-its-all-i-use-this-machine-for.com/
```

And such; my memory isn't perfect though I'd have to hope the NSA, or perhaps my internet provider Spectrum, could provide verification.

Look, does that seem weird to you? I'll tell you a bit about myself then, but, just a bit.

...

~~For the past 45 years I've been an undercover spy, with the first 8 being before I escaped my mother's womb~~

I'm a computer programmer, and I've been one for like, 15 years. At times I've made some entrepreunerial endeavors that may have seemed "political."

In 2012 I helped coordinate a website called WeTheLobby dot com, with the intent of crowd funding lobbying money to fight SOPA, a potential bill which was later dropped rendering the site's intent a bit meaningless, and frankly the idea was a bit naiive itself.

In 2020, I tried crowdfunding a game out of a beta that had the intent of donating it's revenue to groups fighting against COVID 19 as well as climate change, with a hope to broaden it's scope and make the donations a matter of choice, so no one felt politically forced. However, I did attempt to co opt a rising tide of "social media socialism" that may have made me, to the eyes of the Feds a decade after WeTheLobby, a "person of internet based interest" or whatever.

I'm not sure if it makes me more or less suspicious, but in the previous decade, I've not been a terribly active social media user. I don't like the stuff; I tried to make it work for a game project idea, but other than that social media isn't very me, which, I don't know, could be perceived as odd if you were investigating me.

So, I wasn't that surprised that I was being looked into this way. And if I was wrong -- it may have just been a random BSOD after all, or, some background process caused the crash, etc -- then I just typed in some of the stupidest URLs of all time that no one would buy for any reason. Also I don't think dashes are allowed in URLs, but, I digress.

That said, the attempt in 2020 and into 2021 to put together a game idea called _The Promised Land_ -- based more on the Springsteen song, and particularly the earnest part in the bridge about blowing away lies, but whatever -- had left me worse for the wear. Politically speaking, I've never thought ideologies are of much importance practically speaking, and that comes more from computer programming than not. Great, you're a functional programmer. If you're hired to work on an object oriented program, what're you gonna do, protest about it?

In truth, most programs are a mish mash of the ideals, and not ideologies, of the programmers who work on the program over days, months, years, and sometimes decades. The trick with object oriented programming, after all, is not to do too much of it, and otherwise, be like a functional programmer as much as possible in your constructs. Yes, the why not both? meme, that one.

Without accusing anyone of infantile behavior, I do wonder if social media is an appropriate place to discuss politics, given that honest dialogue over ideologies has never been a very _honest_ game, or in other words, remember when they used to say "off with their head?" Anyway, my attempt to infiltrate social media such to make a video game finance charities and good causes may have failed, and I don't think it has to do with any political ideology nearly as much as how much social media has distorted the value of fame -- it's cheaper than it looks.

Which is to say, after 2021, I decided to check out due to burn out, and stopped paying attention to politics and news media altogether. However, I had made an instagram account where I was playing guitar as a distraction, and a way to understand what I had missed out on over the last decade when I avoided social media -- why were people in such need for "likes"? I personally tracked my own habits with the program, how it made me feel, and had some fun with guitar riffs, so it may have been hard to "pattern" me using social media data.

Did that seem weird to them? It may have, idk. Looking back at the videos, I mostly feel I could have worked out a bit more as I was very skinny, but my playing seemed OK, and some people hit the like button on my reels, and that made me feel good.

So, in early 2022, I just wanted a job. Three companies gave me offers, and during one final interview, a CFO not at Vouch spoke highly of the CEO at Vouch, influencing my decision in an ironic way. I often wonder what if I wasn't impressed at someone else being impressed at someone so much that I went in that direction? Alas, I was grateful for the opportunity, and based on Vouch's position as a startup focused insurer, I felt the equity would work out, just as long as the Fed kept printing money at a consistent rate, the startup machine would never stop, not soon at least.

...

That Friday, January 28th 2022, When I got the email from the HR person at Vouch about onboarding there was some odd correspondence with regards to background checks and SSNs, which were being asked of separately. Why would a company want my SSN privately, as well as ask me to do a background check which would ask me the same information, and weeks before I would fill out an I9 tax document with the information anyway? It seemed a bit confusing to me, but I gave the SSN privately via a phone number provided, and filled out the online background check separately. Startups can be sloppy sometimes, it's not that big of a deal.

Anyway, I was working in NYC, for a company which had offices in San Francisco and Chicago, and talking to an HR person based in Chicago with about 3 other HR people CC'd. The background check form asked for a zip code for the company -- I looked up the first SF zip code I could find, hit enter, and was asked by the website to review the information first. I checked SF zip codes, and noticed there were a few. I then began to wonder if the company was actually, tax wise or whatever, based in Chicago. I didn't feel like looking shady and screwing up the background check form, so I asked Friday afternoon around 3 PM Chicago time via the email chain what the zip code was.

There were 3 other people, including the recruiter who worked with me earlier whom was also in the mid west, on the email, and no one responded. I didn't hit the final submit on my background check form.

Later that evening, while reviewing the company's PDF, looking at the pinwheel diagram which explained that the company would pickup the "best" startups (I assumed that meant those with the most VC traction) and stick with them as they grew, thus, the premiums would grow with the companies. Seemed smart, I thought, as long as the economy sticks with big tech, my equity might work out and not just my bosses'. At that high point, having just secured employment, and feeling as though I had made the right choice between three offers -- my Windows 10 gaming and music production machine did something it hadn't ever done before: given me it's Blue Screen Of Death.

I assumed the worst, I suppose, and handled it as best I could. On Monday, I hadn't received a response from Vouch, so around 3 PM (nts: check emails) I reached out. I received a response shortly after saying the background check actually cleared -- but I had never hit "confirm" on the final submission. Perhaps the company gathered the data pre-emptively, but, I still found this a bit, well, shady.

That said, a job's a job, and a white woman in Chicago working in an HR department can think a lot of things about a brown man in NYC working remotely for a tech department, and if a mistake was made, I wouldn't of minded if it stopped there.

> "In any kind of covert operation, one of the toughest challenges is using information you're not supposed to have." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Working remotely wasn't new to me -- somewhere two decades ago around 2001 my father, who worked for IBM for some 3 decades, was transferred away from his office in Cranford NJ and into his home office in our house of Montclair NJ. I believe this was mostly because the office was closing in Cranford and seen as a way to save money. My father finished his career working remotely, and, given the times, audio surveillance wasn't really something I ever felt IBM put into our family household, and was mostly something for the likes of TV shows.

These days, as more move to remote working whether due to chronic health issues as well as epidemics like Covid, costs savings, comfort, or all three, it's well known many corporations are utilizing audio surveillance as it's more feasible with modern CPUs.

Before 2020, I was upset the way I discovered this -- via a boss' psychological immaturity -- but by 2022, I accepted it as some kind of weird reality.

...

Back in 2020, I went through an experience that confirmed to my suspicions that some companies in "big tech" were using audio surveillance on their remote employees. As a computer programmer, I knew this wasn't hard to pull off and hide -- audio processing takes a minute amount of power on a modern CPU, to where it wouldn't interfere with the average worker bee's day. The way I figured out was the immaturity in how the audio surveillance was being used -- it seemed if I setup myself as a joke, my bosses were more than likely to play off it in meetings, indicating they were listening, and they were not threatened but willing to use it as a cheap way to feel superior, like children. But that was then.

In 2020, I was working for a former frat boy president running a startup in an industry known for emotional immaturity, surrounded by mid 30s and 20 year olds. In 2022, I was starting at Vouch, a company being run by 40 year olds, surrounded by 30 year old co workers, in the decidedly more mature industry of business insurance. I thought, before starting, that even if they used audio surveillance, surely they'd be more mature about it.

...


I really enjoy working remotely. I enjoy it mostly because while I'm working, there aren't a bunch of people flying around an office, alerting my peripheral vision, talking aloud about reasonable topics I have to filter out with maturity or music, which itself can be a distraction, taking a shit around people and having to deal with the social consequences -- literally none of these things are things I have to deal wiht remotely. Studies show there isn't much "productivity" to be gained via the "in person water cooler" moments, but, I'll admit many humans are more social creatures than I, so an office may be ideal and needed for many others.

I think the "remote first" model with an office to support those with social needs would be best for the future, but alas.

I also like to talk aloud while I write or evaluate computer programs.

In offices, I limit this to an occasional one word mumble, if anything. Sometimes, I may make the more embarassing mistake of singing along to what I'm listening to.

"Alone" in my apartment, I'll sometimes carry a bit of a conversation about the code I'm working on. It may sound like I'm talking to someone on the phone -- I'm just thinking one thought, then saying another aloud. I like to think I'm hijacking the part of the brain that listens, and just speeding up the process of being as obejctive as I can in my approaches to computer programming.

You might think it's crazy, but I've talked to a lot of therapists about it, and they don't, often categorizing it as a type of self talk.

All these things came to an odd head of sorts early on at Vouch. My instinct was not to care, because, if it was a problem, surely someone would be direct and just ask me about it.

Wouldn't you do that if you were confused about something a co-worker or employee said aloud to themselves or anyone else in an office?

Why would working remotely be any different, even with audio surveillance replacing the idea of a shared amount of oxygen in an office setting?

After 2022, I wonder if emotional immaturity is more acceptable compared to pure political cowardice. I didn't get a severance after being harrassed via "covert" audio surveillance in 2020, but at least compared to 2022 the government never got involved, at least to my knowledge, and certainly not my _mother_.

...

_Early February 2022_ (nts: get weeks where needed from notes and calendar, should be second week of Feb)

My first two days at Vouch were of little incident or consequence. I met my manager, Eloise, and thought she was really friendly. She had a Steve Martin poster her wife had bought with hats referencing many of his movies, and was fairly outgoing. There was a meeting for the new employees to meet the "C Levels" - the C*O's of the company, the top leadership structure of the then ~ 50 employee large firm - it was scheduled for Tuesday, but cancelled suddenly in the morning. I thought that was a bit weird, but not a big deal.

Another thing I thought was weird was Ronnie Wang, a woman I had interviewed with some 3 weeks ago, whom held a Director position and would have been my boss' boss, was not at the company when I joined. That meant she likely hadn't told them she was leaving when she interviewed me (nts: check dates, think it was 1/24), and gave her two weeks notice the following week. This is irregular for a Director -- typically a departure is coordinated with months, not an employee's standard two weeks, given their importance to the company.

Unless, for some reason, she, didn't care and decided to quit, giving Vouch the least time to react. I checked on LinkedIn and couldn't imagine her equity position being better where she landed, another tech finance outfit. I took a mental note: _evaluate Vouch's organization -- if they seem disorganized, that meant Ronnie ran things and she left abruptly to make a point. If they don't seem disorganized, then maybe I'm wrong._

When I was first hired, my boss was to be a man named Eric, and a week after I got the offer, I was told it would be a woman named Eloise. No biggie, but a sudden shift in internal management usually points to disorganization.

Just some things I told myself to keep in mind should the company appeared disorganized or mismanaged at a later time.

...

It's not terribly abnormal to _not_ get a work item your first week on a tech gig as a web developer -- usually you're setting up the code bases of whatever program you're working on so you have a "local" or "development" setup on your machine that you can use to edit code in an isolated fashion, separate from whatever live servers run the business. Setting things up took awhile, but I recall being up and running within my first few days.

I was hired to largely be a front end developer -- this is the part of the website that runs in your device's browser, and communicates to the server. I have experience with working the latter, but for this job, my focus was a leadership role in the former. One thing I don't take for granted is that as a front end developer, I'm largely divorced from any customer data while working on my local environment. That said, the concept of _authentication_ -- one of the principal things that happens whenever you supply a user and password -- does partially happen on the client side, even if the important part -- the part where the password gets checked for validity -- doesn't; that's on the server.

So, while reviewing the codebase to which I was hoping to dedicate years of my life to, I looked at, well, the page I was looking at when I started my local development setup - the login page.

You may be familiar with the idea of a login page.

One thing I often do is look at the code that assembles the page to see how it behaves: it's a big part of my job.

The login page being the first page I looked at had a lot to do with the website in question - the company's "app." website to manage data, not it's more sales oriented main "www." website - locking you out until you login... like... many if not most data oriented websites.

While looking at the login page for Vouch's site, I noticed they were using a third party provider for authentication that I was familiar with - _Auth0_. Now, if you asked me to my _face_ my opinion on whether a company like Vouch - dozens of developers, 8 figures in funding - needs or ought to be relying on a third party provider for something like authentication, I'd be more polite.

I'm pretty sure I said some judgemental things, and out loud but to myself as I said before, such as:

> "Why would they still be using this? Are they not equipped enough to handle authentication internally with this many developers? Maybe there's a reason but that seems kind of sloppy if you ask me. They even have the more tacked on version than not. Why pay so much money for a service? Whatever, at least I'm familiar with it."

I'm not really... _sure_ what I said, to be honest, because I was just wondering why a company that size, with that many developers, without the need for dynamic machine to machine keys or anything really that Auth0 provides -- why would they need this?

Honestly, there may have been a good answer! I may have been being judgemental. To myself, alone, in my apartment.

To be clear: three days into a job, I do have to say that I wasn't "casing the joint", because, as a matter of knowing how to do my job as a web developer -- knowing that Vouch.us uses Auth0 would be simple as visiting their incredibly public website and seeing Auth0's URLs listed somewhere in the requests made to compose the incredibly public website Vouch.us used that they were hiring me to help make.

It's kind of like seeing the brand name of a lock on the door of your employer's office, probably not something weird for the guy who works on the front of the employer's office, website wise, to take note of.

Meaning, finding out Vouch used Auth0 for authentication wasn't a secret. If I wanted to know, I could've found out without every working there or looking at their code.

But again, I may have sounded _really_ judgemental.

That was Wednesday, and other than making a note to ask someone why they used it, and another note to myself to be nice about it and not "judgy" when I asked, I didn't think much else about it. Every developer would make every website different given their own choices; if anything I just told myself I may have to spend time with Auth0, a product I had experience in from previous jobs, and moved on with my business from there.

... 

When starting a job with a new company email, I make a losing effort to check all my email and retain the fabled "inbox 0" state of zero emails unread in my inbox.

It works for the first few weeks.

That first week, it was working - I had read every email, just as a way to get familiar with the company.

On Thursday, I got a somewhat peculiar email that made me think, for the first time that year, that _another_ company may be audio surveilling me.

But I couldn't be sure -- to be honest, I still can't without the company admitting to it -- so I asked myself a complicated question that was maybe my "programmer brain" solving a social problem I could have been better ignoring:

_How could I let them know that I didn't care if they were listening to me without doing anything weird, like asking them in a meeting my first week if they were listening to me?_

I really, really, hate meetings.

My boss' boss made an update to some internal company document, and the software which holds the document sent an email to a mailing list I was on about the update. I can't remember all the points, but under a section with about 4 bullet points, a fifth one was added, and it made the section read like one of those multiple choice questions, with the prompt asking you _which one does not belong_.

The last point, erroneous to the preceeding points, was about authentication.

My boss' boss, the CPO, wasn't terribly technical and neither were the points in the list - authentication is a pretty technical term, most other departments, including Product, may refer to this as the login section.

That said, I'm new! I could be wrong! It's just... an email?

But I was considering the BSOD from earlier, my experiences from 2020, and began considering that I could be under some kind of "investigation", with a possibility of federal involvement, and that my boss' boss, a fellow male of South Asian decent, may have been trying to... tell me something?

Which I thought was weird - why wouldn't he just... tell me? The thought came to me:

_How could I let them know that I didn't care if they were listening to me without doing anything weird, like asking them in a meeting my first week if they were listening to me?_

And then another, qualifying thought, asking this:

_Why am I suspicious and what are the rational ways I could be correct such to justify the above would have any effect, and what happens if I'm wrong?_

If you're not a computer programmer, that's ok. Just read the below like words, and ignore the other parts.

It's how I thought through the situation.

You might think I'm foolish.

```
if you_live_in_2022_aka_audio_surveillance_is_technically_feasible then
    if you_do_something_to_let_them_know_you_dont_care then
        if they_are_not_listening then
            nothing_will_happen_that_would_be_odd_or_connected_because_they_are_not_listening
        else
            if they_are_investigating_you then
                hopefully_they_would_be_direct_at_that_point
            else
                hopefully_they_would_be_direct_at_that_point
            end
        end
    end
end
```

Take your time with it, but to translate in english, the logical answer to the question "why would I react to this in such a way to test if they were audio surveilling me" would be this:

_If I live in 2022 and audio surveillance is thus technically feasible in a remote working scenario, and then I do something like saying words to the audio surveillance to indicate to anyone listening or recording that I am not threatened by it's presence, if they're indeed not listening, then nothing should come of it, elsewise, if they are listening, whether or not they are investigating me, hopefully they would be direct at that point._

As a programmer, you rarely get it right the first time, even if you write perfect tests and such.

Sometimes you just need to run the program to find out you were wrong about an assumption you made.

So, well, "FML" as the kids say, but I thought of the above and figure'd what harm could come if, in my apartment, I vocally addressed my suspicions about the email, and finished by saying something like the below:

> "Look, if you're audio surveilling me I don't care. I'd be more impressed if you were listening to me in my kitchen, but anyway, I don't care. Do what you need to."

I can't remember my exact words because, at this point, I didn't think it would be necessary to try and remember things like that, but I do remember the line about the kitchen. Perhaps my latent heterosexism caused me to lean on a bit of machismo -- I'm saying I don't care, but, I hadn't realized an easily bullied, triggerable leader who likes to play games more than mind their business may react by thinking: _Well, if he wants to be impressed, let's impress him._

My empathy limits it's bounds at sociopathy. It's probably why I've never been interested in middle management.

Anyway, I remember at that point going to my kitchen and talking random shit about Silicon Valley, but really just focusing on the whole "you ruined San Francisco" thing, while washing my dishes. I didn't say anything personal -- I barely knew these people, I just started working there -- so I stuck to general shit talk about how the Mission sucks and it used to be better (I cannot prove this to be honest), and how the Warriors _probably_ only got Durant because of some backwater deal involving tech stocks, but I digress -- my random espionage tinged encouters with NBA celebrity come up later in my story.

...

Earlier in the week I had met my "team", or the coworkers I would be working closesly with in my department. Everyone was very friendly and introduced themselves with all kinds of info - their hobbies, their families, their recent projects at work - except for one person, who spoke briefly if ever and was not present at the meeting where I introduced myself to everyone, a Rachel Bird.

I did see her in Slack, a chat software, as well as a few online meetings, however, she spoke tersely in response to Eloise when prompted, and her face was hidden. In it's stead an image she had uploaded was displayed, and it was a black and white photo of a woman in a hairstyle along with the kind of lighting and exposure that meant it was a photo of an old actress, likely from the 30s-50s.

Rachel never made conversation so I never got to ask, but I remember thinking to myself, a former Blockbuster employee, this:

_Hey, is that a picture of Ingrid Bergman, famous for her character Paula in the 1944 film_ Gaslight?

I wasn't certain, though I was grateful at that moment for my mother and her mother, my grandmother's, habit of watching _Nick at Nite_ as well as daytime reruns, and thus knowing a bit about older films and television. Even if I was wrong, and though these films are older, looking back on what happened I am _especially_ grateful to my grandmother for loving shows like _Matlock_, _Columbo_, and of course _Murder She Wrote_, and I wonder how much those helped in deducing how full of shit many of you all were and may still be.

Per my uncertainty, I thought about googling for pictures of Ingrid Bergman, or even aking Rachel, but then I realized I might be under some sort of surveillance which meant monitoring my internet connection, and I didn't want to give anyone at the company the impression that I was interested in someone.

Rachel's last day was the following Friday, an interesting day for me as well.

...

With disregard to "surveillance," working from home generally involves making sure you're visibly online in some sort of chat software, at the very least, though it's not always required. I was making a habit in my first week of opening my laptop at just about 10:30 AM ET and signing off at 7:30 PM ET. I'd generally take a half hour to hour long lunch so this worked out to a 9 hour total workday.

On the last day of my first week, when I opened my laptop, I couldn't connect to the internet.

These things happen. I check my phone and see a text message.

Spectrum, my internet provider, had texted me at 10:28 AM that day, February 18th, 2022 -- I had a service outage (nts: maybe link photo if you can. given that tying this to an actual pitch will definitely mean taking it out of markdown and into "something else", it may be difficult, look into how things are normally pitched, if a PDF is ok then use some markdown to website to PDF generator, etc).

These things happen! Not wanting to be virtually "late", I thought little of taking out my iPhone and using it's internet to tether to, and continued working. I had some meetings where I chose not to share my webcam feed to save on data as well as keep my internet connection stable.

I moved into the building I live in around 10 years ago, and have "suffered" internet outages before. Post 2012, when I moved in, the internet was pretty stabalized as a necessity to do most things, though not all. When outages happen, especially on nice days -- it was a bright, sunny, not that chilly or windy February day, beautiful realy -- people tend to congregate outside a bit more, and Covid wasn't as much of a threat by 2022. I noticed near the mid afternoon that, well, things outside seemed pretty normal.

Funny, but, hey. I was tethered to my phone; maybe everyone else was too.

I decided to then walk down the hall to throw some garbage out in the chute. As I walked, I could hear many of my neighbors living their lives rather normally as they would at that time -- many worked from home, had meetings like I did, and many watched television during the day while working or otherwise from their apartments, such audio is normal -- but in 2022, it would assume that everyone else had a working internet connection but me.

I check Twitter primarily for evidence of an outage in my area, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, anywhere in Manhattan at that moment -- I couldn't find anything saying that others were suffering an outage.

I sighed inside, and thought through some things.

end
```

In english, _if my internet connection is down, but my neighbors isn't, and somehow this was done in response to me saying Id be more impressed if you audio surveilled me in my kitchen, and it makes me wonder why Ronnie left abruptly as a Director, then I ought to try and embarass whoever did this, because if they have government connections, they're fascists, if not, they're just bullies, and if none of this is "really connected", then I don't have anything to worry about because nothing else will happen if I try to embarass whomever did this, because then in that case, they didn't_.

The next logic puzzle was figuring out how to respond; what to say and why.

...

It was maybe 10 months later, but when I watched the Emilio Estevez cinematic classic _Men at Work_, lines of dialogue shared by he and his brother Charlie Sheen's characters described exactly what I wanted to achieve, with, well, a prank.

> James: ... a pellet gun? What are you going to accomplish using that stupid thing?
>
> Carl: It allows me to seriously aggravate a situation without actually changing the course of history. It also stings like a b***h.

It took me maybe 3 months later, but I also for the first time watched _Apolcalypse Now_ in full, and couldn't help but note Coppola and Company's stressing the point of emotional immaturity not just amongst the ranks of the infantry, but through the leadership as well, perhaps best expressed in Robert Duval's role of Colonel Kilgore.

I didn't need to watch that movie to know that the most powerful military in the world, at any point in history, has had to suffer the mistakes of youth as influenced by emotional immaturity, and will continue to. Calling things out directly isn't always helpful as the immaturity can be within the ranks of leadership or legal outfits at say, the JAG level; the court system which would handle military affairs separate from civil ones.

(Also, _Apocalypse Now_ centers around Martin Sheen's character's mission is to "take care of" his former comrade Marlon Brando's character, so, I felt a prank would be better than anything "official".)

A year later in 2023, as i write this, the country was rocked by an intelligence leak. One Jack Texiera stands accused of accessing classified military information and then spreading it online, on a gamer chat service called Discord of all things. I'd fear for the country's security if not for the fact that Mr. Texiera's actions reflects the immaturity often found in military outfits historically, which is to say, such things aren't distinctly American.

That is said, in 2022, I didn't know Jack Texiera's name, but I figure'd whoever was behind this -- if they were at all -- had the emotional maturity of a 20 year old who spends their time on online chat services and social media.

If they were older or less male it woudn't matter, at least the former point was proven to me by Robert Duvall's performance as Colonel Kilgore: even those in charge can be reduced to children if you figure out what their surf board is and take it away.

Whomever my Colonel Kilgore was, their surf board to me seemed like the ability to take my internet connection down - "just to see how I'd react." Such tactics are useful against criminal organizations, but, I'm not that, and there's no evidence to point me to that in a way a court order could be aquired to legally take my internet down, so, I felt like it was time to take away my Colonel Kilgore's surf board, whomever they were.

If I got away with it, I'd never know who it was, and technically, I still don't.

...

My mission was clear: I needed to embarass whoever did this in a way that would have no effect if I was wrong, but if I was right, my actions would have to would force whoever did this to take action amongst their superiors within the government which would eventually embarass them.

_What are these people hoping for anyway?_

If they took down my internet, they were probably thinking they'd "interrupt" whatever "criminal" activities I "must" be doing using that connection. If the police know of a location where drug dealers use say, any type of electricity, as those growing hydroponic marijuana indoors may with the halogen lights requried to do so, then sometimes they'll cut the electricity of the area to see how the drug dealers will react. Maybe they'll change locations, reveal their stashes, or act erratically in a way which adjusts their business operations to reveal to authorities what they were up to.

Marijuana having been legalized by 2022 in the great state of New York, I looked at my bong with little fear. I rarely had over the legal limit of marijuana, most times nowhere close to the 3 ounce maximum (nts: check laws). I asked myself a peculiar question which has since, become rather standard form procedure in any of my thought processes:

_Am I doing anything illegal right now?_

In terms of crimes that would get me behind bars or serve any "jail time", no. At times you could get me on misdemeanors -- jaywalking, mostly -- but, no, in the time that I was being investigated up to this moment, I've not committed any crimes that would put me behind bars.

So, then what to do given that I knew my innocence was provable?

The thought came to mind:

_I also need to prevent them from falsely incriminating me._

My only answer there was this: I need to be as appealing of a possible "collar" or "get" to the person as I can be, such that they will act in earnest, up until the point that they ask the investigative services (FBI, most likely) to look into my background, at which point they'll find nothing, and be embarassed by not only their superiors but hopefully create a minor inter-departmental "snafu" and forever be known as "that guy" -- Jack Texiera should live a healthy, full life, but he should, in my opinion, have no way up the ladder in terms of government employment as well.

In most programming languages, a "function" is a group of code that can be refered to by it's name and thus "executed," similar to having a play "codenamed" in say a sports game or an intelligence operation and having that name refer to a predetermined set of actions.

```

      else if they_keep_bothering_me then
        mission_impossible = "its fucking on bro"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

I'll admit, this set of logic was a bit more dynamic than previous sets. I probably could have come up with a lot of other ways to satisfy my base constraints which were:

1. I need to get whoever did this to take it further up the chain so I'm investigated by the FBI with NSA assistance, most likely. This will clear my name and make them look stupid, and probably keep me under whatever tabs I'm under due to previous entrepreunerial ambitions.
1. I need to do it in a way that doesn't let them know I think they're the government
1. I need to do it in a way such that if I'm called out, I can easily explain it as a joke without losing face.

Here's what I came up with, and yes, it was probably heavily inspired by my favorite TV show of all time, _Burn Notice._ I was going to convince them that actually, I was working for the government. I was hpoing that would be easy enough to sort out as ridiculous, for, the government.

Me, to my laptop, without any meetings in the background, while I was writing code or checking emails, sometime that afternoon of February 18th, 2022:

> "Wow. You got me. You got some mob connection to cut the wire in my apartment building and now my internet connection is down. I'm really scared -- look, now I'm going to have to do a bunch of paperwork. I appreciate your efforts to have fun here, but, if you could just not pull that little stunt again, and treat me like a normal employee, I think we'll be ok."

I never said "I'm a spy" or that I "work for the government" -- just that I knew it was them that cut my internet connection down, and that I assumed they hired a "mob" person to "cut the wire" in my building, things I certainly wasn't actually suspicious of, but I figure'd it would give enough cover to the superiors in this situation to pull out as I wasn't suspicious and things were better that way if they ended that way.

Things did not end that way, but maybe that's my fault.

I didn't think much more of the situation until I ended that afternoon with a 1:1 with my manager Eloise, and she told me why Rachel Bird, after a two month paid leave, was leaving Vouch for good.

...

After all the above and near the end of the afternoon, somewhere past 4 PM ET if I remember correctly, I had my final meeting - a 1:1 with my manager Eloise. I had several meetings and 1:1's with her during my first week as one might expect being a new employee and she my boss. I thought we got along and established a fairly normative baseline as to how she communicated professionally as well as personally. I felt this meeting, though it was still my first week, was a bit erratic in comparison.

She asked me how my day was, and I briefly explained this morning my internet was down, so I just tethered to my iPhone.

I'm not a good poker player. In my opinion, it's because I like to have fun with playing cards, not just look, run some math in my head, and then fold. If you don't spend most of your time doing the latter, you lose.

That said, I do know that one of the more common "tells" in poker is when someone places a bet, and as they pick up or move chips towards the center of the table to represent their wager, if they hands shake -- if they show _any_ sign of expended energy, really -- it's a solid sign they're trying to _hide_ their emotions, typically meaning they have good cards and they don't want you to know so you call. Bluffers stereotypically get more stoned up or solid then they were previously; hence the term "Poker Face."

As she responded to my internet being down, Eloise had something to hide, in my opinion. She broke all normative cadences and spoke in a way I hadn't and would not hear her speak in again. Her voice pitched way up, near a Mickey Mouse falsetto to indicate slight shock, and then she had to take down her pitch as she finished her sentence in response to my explanation abou tethering, displaying a nervous excitement to which she had to recognize then put away mid sentence.

(nts: I could probably make a musical staff spell out her pitch changes, I do remember her voice pretty well)

> "Oh, well! There are _so many ways_ you can connect to the internet today!"

I mean, she didn't fumble her chips and drop them everywhere, but typically people hiding something aren't terribly obvious about it. Her voice indicated shock at the points of exclamation as well as italicized areas in the above quote.

I took it to mean a few things:

```
if eloise_acted_with_shock then
  if eloise_knew_about_them_taking_my_internet_down then
    she_was_pissed_off_because_she_told_them_id_just_tether_anyway
  else if eloise_did_NOT_know_they_took_my_internet_down then
    she_probably_has_her_suspicions_based_on_prior_knowledge
  end
else if eloise_did_not_act_shocked then
  i_would_have_not_noticed
else if im_just_mistaken_and_confused then
  none_of_my_actions_would_have_resulted_in_anything_as_I_never_was_direct_at_that_point
end
```

So if Eloise _did_ know they took my internet down, I registered her shock as the common annoyance of a manager who was rebuffed by her superiors -- she knew it was dumb, she told them I'd just tether onto my iPhone and they'd learn nothing, and if anything it may make me suspicious. If Eloise _did not_ know thye took my internet down, then her shock indicated to me possible prior knowledge of management above her acting in this extra legal fashion, which would explain why she told me what she told me next.

Again, it was my first week, Eloise really didn't have to tell me what she was about to tell me.

Apparently, someone named Rachel Bird was quitting, the only person on the team I hadn't really seen in person as I had mentioned. Eloise went on to tell me that Rachel Bird came back this Monday, my first day, from a two month paid leave due to a previous incident of sexual harrassment.

My manager Eloise told me that Rachel was sexually harrassed by a fellow employee, whom was asked to leave prior to my joining. I beat Eloise to the punch in offering an explanation so she wouldn't have to, saying that "I guess Rachel didn't feel comfortable coming back to memories of a bad situation" which, I felt was fair to the new company I was just joining, without revealing what I was thinking myself, without or perhaps relieving Eloise of a need to offer an explanation which might cast judgement on the company we both worked for that Rachel was leaving.

Later I would find out from another coworker, Damon Hastings, that actually Rachel Bird left because she was harassed not by one employee but two -- and the second still works at the company.

That said, Eloise went on. Reader, I'll admit, at this point I may be combining two stories from two separate meetings.

In _this_ meeting I am sure Eloise told me that one of the first things she had to do as an incoming manager months before (she was somewhat new as well) was in fact to help the company "deal with" the sexual harrassment situation. I can't remember if she told me in this meeting or a previous one, but Eloise had described previous experience in the online Business Insurance world, in a separate life where she was married to a man at that company.

At that company, she divorced a man for the woman she is currently married to, and whose approval I implicitly give for the Steve Martin poster Eloise's wife owned. This divorce led to workplace harrasment I believe of another employee at that company, one in whcih Eloise had to navigate as a manager.

I commiserated as best I could without pointing fingers: "That must have been really hard, dealing with something like that - I can't even imagine - butt then having to deal with it _again_ at a new company. I'm so sorry, that must be so tough as a manager."

Eloise was gracious in my attempt to be as close to such a thing, but, I did wonder why she was telling me about Rachel Bird, of all times, now.

I could do the computer programming thing, but you're probably already thinking what I was:

`Eloise probably knows or assumes Rachel went through similiar internet manipulations based on their private communications, and is trying to tell me that's what is happening without risking her own job, as yes, it's most likely several C levels are watching this meeting now or will watch a recording, if I'm right about my internet connection being taken down by them of course. If I'm wrong, then nothing will happen, and this is just an unfortunate history, and I've somehow deeply earned Eloise's trust within a week.`

Or, of course, they asked Eloise to tell me all of those things to see how I'd react. Maybe if they were lucky they would've caught a sexist AND a hacker?

I try not to be the former, and I've never tried to be the latter; the former being a societally taught impulse and the latter taking criminal intent I didn't have. Which is to say, it wasn't the loudest thought in my mind at the time.

I was lightly pondering all of this while I was speaking to her and as though to answer, and confirm in my opinion Eloise was asked to tell me these things by her superiors, she tells me this:

> "So, if you're feeling any tension or anything, it's probably over Rachel."

As a contractor, I've made short roles at I don't know how many companies. Internal strife and drama isn't rote but not uncommon, and it's largest feature is the employee departure for numerous reasons, not always harassment. That said, I know the feeling between a new coworker feeling awkward about _someone else_ vs them feeling awkward about myself.

In my opinion, it felt like whomever took my internet connection down planned to coordinate amongst lower level employees, and wanted me to think their emotional cues meant something else.

The next time I felt suspicious of this was with no coincidence at my very next job, but I didn't know that at the time.

I just knew that in a normal situation, Eloise would have probably told me nothing more than that Rachel had quit, and probably in front of the rest of the team on Monday, and that would've been that - and yes, to avoid tension. So I was pretty sure I wasn't in a normal situation.

...

Reader, you may be wondering: if they _had_ confronted you, and asked why you lied about being a government spy or intelligence worker of some sort, what would I have said?

I had made a plan, and it was to respond thusly, if I was asked why I lied.

_Oh, well I thought we were both lying about being spies. That wasn't the joke here?_

Look, I probably would've gotten fired, but like I said I had two other job offers and if things happened quickly I doubt they would've gotten to a point where the government would have to try the loudest "cover up" of all time as opposed to just minding their own business.

Alas, maybe more people are pretending at what they are than I realize.
# Pt 1 ch 3 -- Second week at Vouch (2/20/22)

### Draft

> "You should be happy, Michael. We all live American dream -- dream spies like you helped make. Open borders, free markets, everyone's friends." Peter J. Lucas as Pyotr Chechik from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

My second week was, all things considered, normal, in that my second week at most companies I spend my time assessing the company itself as much as I can against any workload assigned. At that point, I had the central code bases setup on my computer and running, and had a decent idea of how the code reflected against the things and behaviors presented on the screen in front of me.

There's a tool many developers use called `git` which is a VCS, or Version Control System. Developers use `git` and tools like to sequentially add and track changes to code in a project and within a team; it could be thought of as a shared Google Doc of sort, just for code, and with a lot more formality.

The formality gives developers a log of changes that is easily reviewable. In fact, running the command `git blame` and supplying both a filename and a line number will tell you the history of that line of code; who changed it, when, and what they had to say about it. The keyword `blame` is perhaps a bit unfortunate and was a joke at the time of it's inception in 90s.

That said, `git blame` is my favorite tool for assessing a company against it's codebase. Along with `git log`, you can easily see not just what code went through the most changes, but _who_ makes the most important changes in code. One tell tale sign of a poorly run company, in a general sense, is employee attrition -- do people not stay at the company for long?

At Vouch, when looking at their codebase, there were several names that read important to the code, that simply weren't present at the company. Asking about them got a nervous look at best, and generally current employees don't like talking about previous ones - particularly if they left out of disapointment.

Disappointment from a developer's point of view is easy to track with `git log` and `git blame` - most developers like myself are, if anything, overly exuberant in the English messages we leave when we "commit" code. At the beggining, like most employees, the exuberant developer _over_ writes.

However, over time, the exuberant new developer becomes more aclimated to the fact that no one listens to them, and adjusts their messages accordingly.

Soon, massive code changes are accompanied with one to two word commit messages, with major code alterations being paired with the explanation of "hot fix", where only months ago the formerly exuberant developer was writing paragraphs to explain lines of code changes.

And then, they quit, or from my perspective, were no longer part of the company.

By my second week at Vouch, I had diagnosed all of these things in previous developers as well as my current team mates, particularly Tony Thompson, who had a similar set of skills to me as a developer and I was to work closely with. This disheartened me to say the least.

But code is only one way to judge the internal behaviors of a tech firm. The other way is seeing how clear the _process for requesting code changes_, in any form, is.

...

That Monday or Tuesday I was invited to a shared Google Doc discussing a large tech change to the way insurance plans were categorized. The doc was exhaustive, multiple pages, and seemed to be a way for the "non tech leadership" to clarify with the tech people what can and can't be built alongside business goals - pretty normal.

The Google Doc was shared amongst most of the development leadership, which included me I suppose but was created before my joining quite clearly, and was also shared amongst the company's C suite employees.

The C levels were making quite a lot of comments and conversation in the google doc.

The surprising thing to me? None of the developers matched the conversation; in fact, in seemed like most did not know or were not willing to speak to leadership at the C level, on a document meant to spark exactly that conversation.

This meant one of two things to me:

```
1. The developers here, despite being rather normal and amicable in comparison to most stereotypes, for some reason turn to stone faced nerds that are afraid to talk to company leadership for _some_ reason

2. That Director named Ronnie who left was probably very important to communicating between leadership and tech, and now that she's gone, literally no one knows how to talk to anyone, and they're also afraid for _some_ reason
```

Given that I felt the company leadership _may_ have leveraged federal resources in an attempt to imagine me as a criminal, I was afraid to imagine the reasons my co workers were also afraid to talk to the company leadership.

That, or, the developers had given up trying to communicate to the leadership, for _some_ reason.

Either way, Vouch, despite it's pedigree and financing, was clearly just another run of the mill disorganized tech company that hides it's lack off efficiency or professionality behind investor graft to make investment appear as value without creating the actual value it represents. Which, is typical.

What kept me from quitting right then and there was my finances, and that I could deal with typical, if it meant a good paycheck. My coworkers were.

That said, while Vouch's lack of professional standards with regards to technology is rather pro forma for most tech companies, particularly startups, I still had to wonder if all of the employees go through a "covert" federal investigation as a matter of routine as well. But, at that point, I could have been wrong about my assumptions, or at least I hoped.

The last thing I found funny in the Google doc was this: the CIO, a John Wallace, made numerous typos; spelling and grammar. Given that he is a top level employee and a leader representing Insurance -- the one thing that kept this company from just being tech, after all -- I thought his lack of attention to detail was alarming, and I do believe I said something out loud about it.

...

My second week at Vouch, like the first, involved several "onboarding" meetings to introduce me to the various departments and leaders of the company. My boss' boss, the Chief Product Officer, was another Indian man named Rajat Kongovi, the same man who I felt had hinted towards authentication in a strange way a week before in an email. His onboarding meeting to represent our shared internal department of Product seemed fine, save for one comment about his fellow C Suite board member, John Wallace.

Rajat said something like this about John:

> And one thing our CIO John Wallace likes to say is "I've never seen a risk I didn't like taking."

Normally, board members take the time to speak positively on each other. This, I felt, was a bit awkward -- an _insurance_ guy is supposed to be a big risk taker?

I was new to business insurance, but that seemed awkward.

Internally, I began to wonder the following:

_Is Rajat trying to hint that John Wallace took my internet connection down, and perhaps had me investigated, knowing the risk would be that I wasn't a criminal and they had no actual evidence, but, since he likes taking risks..._

Also,

_Is Rajat trying to again as I suspected last week "look out" for another Indian guy? If so, why wouldn't he be an adult about it, as well as my boss' boss, and just be direct if there was any issue?_

Felt, shady, to me.

...

Another onboarding meeting, and one I was anticipating learning a lot about being that I had no perception prior to vouch about the "insurance indsutry" in general, was the onboarding meeting for the insurance department.

Given what Rajat just said, as well as my suspicions, as well as wondering "how does a white C level not use proper english in online documents", I was looking forward to this meeting because it was to be led by John Wallace, the CIO himself.

John Wallace did not lead the meeting, and instead sent a female subordinate to do so in his stead. She was nice and informative, but his lack of presence wasn't the weirdest thing about the meeting.

I was onboarding with about 4-5 other people, all outside of my new team led by Eloise, so these were the only meetings I had with them, but I had had a few by that time.

This meeting had one extra screen waiting in the google hangout. I remember thinking it was odd; the camera seemed positioned somewhere near the ceiling and was pointed down towards the floor. I believe the name tag read "Chicago office." I, and the rest of the onboarders, at one point identify that there's an "extra" camera, at which point, something moves on the camera, and it's clear the camera is pointing down - at the _top_ of a young blonde woman's head.

She addresses the audience that has discovered her, tilting her head slightly up but not enough to reveal he rface, and says she's from the HR department, and makes some excuse as to why she was there though not onboarding. She stays for awhile.

One thought comes to mind:

_Did John Wallace hide from this meeting given what I said about his grammar issues as well as my possible reaction to Rajat's quoting him, and send someone to "sit in" on the meeting so he could observe everyone on camera without being seen?_

Ok, sure, but why was she hiding her face? And does John Wallace, out of all the C levels, being the one that oeprates in Chicago -- does he have expanded abilities to manipulate employees given his distance away from other C levels, whom were mostly on the west coast?

It was weird, but then the meeting about insurance started, and I had to learn about premiums.

...

The strangest meeting would be the one led by the company's legal counsel whom I would get to know later, Ms. Kelly Wulff. She handled the company's issues as a GC I believe but also provided advisement towards their business processes to some extent wrt "the law" and "insurance."

Which, was normal.

What wasn't normal was that she, a female lawyer, in 2022, 2 years into a pandemic for a company that had been remote for just as long if not longer, wasn't adjusting her camera lighting and half her face was hidden.

I felt like I was watching a film noir villain in the visage of a "Karen" stereotype.

There's no way she, given her career and gender, did not know that pulling the blinds on her window would hide half her face due to the web cam adjusting to the off balanced light.

We all know this now after Covid. You close the curtain and turn a light on inside, or you pull the curtain to allow light in if it won't overbear your other side.

A _lawyer_ that works remotely would not be able to have meetings regularly hiding their face, and it may be sexist, but in my opinion most female lawyer's wouldn't _risk_ being seen as "shady."

Strange, but was one C level trying to literally hide their face from me, and were they instructing an HR person as well as the legal counsel of the company to also... hide their face from me?

I couldn't help but feel certain that given the times, her position and gender, Ms. Kelly Wulff had to be going for that lighting more so than happen stance her way into it.

It's an awful way to introduce yourself to new employees at any rate. She was very nice, lighting aside however, and informative at that.

Had I nothing else to reflect on, I probably wouldn't worry about the light reflections in Ms. Wulff's room, but, things began to add up to a strange conclusion.

It wouldn't be the last time I felt Ms. Wulff was hiding someone from me, if not herself.

...

Friday morning, 2/25/2022, I started my day like I did back then: reading the news on the iPad in my bathroom while on the toilet. 

As the year passed, I would stop this, largely because I was afraid of finding out what other idiot in the political-journalist sphere wanted to wink at my Netflix situation in a cute way, but that's now, not then.

I remember being shocked to read that Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, began what is now the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, but not surprised. Over the past 8 years or so, a regular article would be Putin moving tanks or military equipment towards the western border of Russia, and international concern would grow, and move on. I remember thinking that I guess this is what all that tank movement was for, but sighing at yet another bloody conflict in the news.

At the time, I was glad to be able to turn the iPad off and get back to my normal life, pretending the news was a separate item that I couldn't affect.

I'm no longer so sure.

A little after noon ET was my small team's daily meeting, such to accomodate the west coasters. Eloise Jones, my manager whom I felt was a little more talkative and informative than normal last Friday, seems to say something which I read as uncomfortable and forced on her part -- as though someone asked -- and personally, I found shocking.

With only so much as the prompt of "sharing stories," Eloise begins to say something like the following:

> "I studied Russian language in college, and the CIA asked me do translation for them. Which is only a serious thing if you really think Vladimir Putin is a threat."

I remember flinching hard, and looking out the window to try and compose my thoughts.

`Uh... does she not know about the conflict? Did she not read the news? Why does Eloise seem oddly excited in a way that says to me she's hiding something? Did someone ask her to say this? And if they did... did _they_ not know about the conflict?`

There's a pause, and since it's a group web call, I can't say Eloise was looking right at me, but I felt like people were waiting for _someone_ to respond. I didn't, didn't mention anything further about politics or the war, and went on with my day, shell shocked by not just the news on my iPad but the potential insinuation of a tech manager not only bringing up politics at work (more an employee thing if ever), but suggesting that _Vladimir Putin wasn't a threat_.

Many things were not right with my world and remain so.

...

I've alluded for the first time in this chapter to my life potentially having been entagled with the operations of well, the political news cycle many of us are addicted to.

Just call me your pusherman, I guess. This is all theory and conjecture, however.

The darkest theory I can construe would have to be this:

`During my first week at Vouch, the company attempted to investigate me alongside the Federal government, utilizing overreach to which I responded to by lying. In order to justify the overreach, the company or the federal government began spreading the idea that I could be "working with Russia", in reflection of their own political ambitions. However, given this happened via internet comms, Russian intelligence may have picked up on this. Realizing I do not have any connection to Russian intelligence, and realizing that the US Gov't broke their own constitution in pursuing me, perhaps Vladimir Putin started a war simply because he knew the US Gov't could be held at arms length via the blackmail of this situation, which Eloise is now being asked to validate on behalf of those that investigated me under false and perhaps illegal pretenses.`

However, I was nowhere near that theory back then because the Ukrainian - Russian conflict hadn't persisted to the point it is has today: nearly a million lives have been lost on both sides, international economics and food supplies have been endangered, and talk of a shifting world order has come to light yet again because of it.

(Not to mention my own continuing conflict with political and private actors attempting to smear me via the utility of a reality TV true crime they may have focused on me when I never actually committed a crime, not a reality TV worthy one at least, to which this memoir becomes focused on in later sections.)

For the most part, I thought my bosses were being idiots, and could use a reminder that to me, this was a joke.

I would later read that Ukraine's leader, Zelensky, was himself a comedian.

It didn't and it doens't make me laugh.

Reader, let me be clear: If I have been a precusor to the conflict in Ukraine, then it's my duty as a Global Citizen to make sure my story is as well known as possible such to prevent digital "intelligence" from being misused by politicans and businesspeople such that a greater conflict, that potential WWIII, could possibly be avoided, and it's the main reason I'm writing this memoir today.

But, reader, to be clear: at the time, late February 2022, I was mostly trying to keep things light hearted and myself employable.
# Pt 1 Ch 4 -- the last normal weekend of my life, 2/25/22

### Draft

> "Often, the best way to get intel is to provoke action, set people in motion. Pros know better, but they usually have to work with a few amateurs, and they panic. So you beat the bushes a little and see what flies out. Once your frightened amateur leads you to the pros, the work begins." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_ 

Entering the weekend, and after that meeting with Eloise, I began to wonder if these people weren't going to get that I was joking. To me, something of a snob, that would only suggest they weren't a company worth spending years with, and I'd find a way out sooner than later, or I'd get fired.

I sighed -- I really, really, really was looking for a company to stay at for years, stabalize my debts, and move out of my expensive apartment to someplace more reasonable after a years worth of saving enough cash to do so. The last few years had been tough on me and many via Covid, and I was looking to get settled.

That said, I realized that if I was right about the company's behaviors, then I wasn't wrong about making a joke out of it. How could you be right when your boss is the one that's wrong? You're not in charge.

One of my new coworkers was a man named Tony Thompson. He was extremely kind during the interview, and after I was given an offer emailed me personally to ask if I had any questions or just wanted to chat while I was considering the offer. While joining, during the "get to know you" session, I found out he learned guitar with his son during the Covid lockdown, and they were both into guitar sound effect pedals; two of my bigger hobbies. I had chatted a few times with Tony online about boutique guitar pedal manufacturers; Chase Bliss, Old Blood Noise Endeavors, and others.

Just prior to joining Vouch, I had setup a "pedal board" - a preconfigured collection of effects pedals placed on a board such that you can move them easily - which I was quite proud of. That weekend I had just figured out some of the ways MIDI worked and decided that it may be a nice way to endear myself to a new colleague I'd be working close with if I shot a video of me playing with the pedals.

One of the pedals, a Chase Bliss MKII Automatone (nts: double check name), has mechanical faders which literally move when you change the preset, which is unique. I setup this and other pedals to have two sound effects, and thought it would be cool to make a video which shows both.

As I often do, I strummed a chord in the 5th fret A Minor position. My guitar, a Sunbust Gibson ES-339, was tuned down a whole step so technically I was playing a G Minor chord.

No one really knows how the brain works, though we have made a lot of progress, it's still largely a mystery why we think what we think when we think it. But for some reason, I heard _The X Files_ theme song in my head, and realized my two presets worked rather perfectly.

(For those unaware or underage, _The X Files_ was an excellent 90s TV series on Fox starring Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny where they played FBI agents working for a fictitious department concerning supernatural, alien activities.)

I could finger pick the lower piano lines, add a delay repeater, and get something similar. The higher pitched lead lines sounded perfectly _spooky_ with the other preset I had setup, and allowed for those cool motorized faders to fly around as I swapped back and forth, first playing the lower notes on one effect preset, then the higher pitched lead lines on another effect preset.

I have a pretty good memory and it's not hard for me to pick out a tune "by ear" as they say, sometimes I combine the two and I can pick out a song from memory. As I went online to double check my memory (I was off a bit rhythmically though not melodically), I chuckled inside, and realized I had maybe solved a problem of how to make it clear that I was joking about being a government worker that now "had a lot of paperwork" to do because of my boss' "little stunt."

_The X Files is a fucking TV show. These people are acting like they're on a TV show to me. Maybe they'll get it if I hint that the government "agency" I work for is the X Files. If they don't there's a chance that my government aided harraser will go around asking if the X Files exists, which, is even better if you ask me._

Tony Thompson had been very charitable with his time in those first two weeks; he chatted with me when he could and always responded with his opinion on whatever guitar pedal got brought up.

I filmed myself on my iPhone playing the X Files theme over the weekend.

I still wasn't sure if anything I was suspicious of was real - to be honest, I was hoping it wasn't and nothing would happen - so I do remember this as the last "normal" weekend of my life, where I didn't have the suspicion of being "watched" inside my own apartment, be it via a digital form of surveillance, or by someone looking at me through my windows, or something else I wasn't aware of.

That said, on Monday when I returned to work, at sometime in the AM before Tony coudl wake up on the West Coast, I uploaded my video of me playing _The X Files_' theme song, and while sending the video over Slack to Tony, said out loud to my audio surveillance laptop the following:

> "This is the only hint I'm gonna give you."

And that was that. If they were dumb enough to get caught up in this, and act like _The X Files_ was real, then, I had to hope my mission of stopping the government career of wahtever 20 year old dipshitted Jack Texiera deserved it was accomplished.

...

I remember a few years ago seeing former CIA director John O. Brennan takling affirmatively about, well, Aliens and shit. They're out there. We don't know much, and what we do can't be explained, but that's what we know. He wasn't exactly shady about it, and kind of smiled during it as I remember. Here's a quote of his I just found on the internet:

> "I think it's a bit presumptuous and arrogant for us to believe that there's no other form of life anywhere in the entire universe."

I was pretty sure, reader, that there was no _X files_ department, and if there was, it probably wasn't all that shady.

That said, you may again be wondering the following: _What exactly would you have said when they asked you why you lied about being a part of the X Files?_

Well, I would have to first allude to playing the guitar, and a decent knowledge of 60s era tunes, but I think I would've said:

_Well, the truth is, if you were listening to my music than you'd already know that I was pretty far out there, man._

Look, it never happened, and things got weirder from there that third week, so I never had a chance to wonder how I'd clean up that line of dialogue, because I never got to deliver it.

I'm sure somewhere Ms. Anderson and Mr. Duchovny, as well as their FakeBI counterparts Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder respectively, would understand. All four of them.

...

Tony Thompson never slack chatted to me again during my employment, never offering his thoughts on my cool pedal board, or what he, a man in his 40s, thought of _The X Files_ when growing up, after responding to everything else we had spoken on that week.

Computer programming ultimately boils down to asking one question a lot: 

_Is this thing on?_

A CPU microchip is a bunch of transistors, which are more or less the same technology as an average light switch. Programming languages give you an abstract way to control these transistors, and how they react to input (keyboards, trackpads), how they respond via output (displays, speakers), and a whole lot of math in between that, at the level of most modern programming languages, you can take for granted.

So you're asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?" But in the format of `if`, `then`, and `else` keywords guiding other logic.

I've gotten used to it, but I often times think through, well, nearly everything that is not confirmable as fact through my head like a programmer.

```
if this_assumption_is_true then
  maybe_react_idk_thats_a_whole_other_question
else if this_assumption_is_false then
  definitely_dont_react_if_you_can_confirm_its_false
else if i_cannot_confirm_the_truth_either_way then
  try_and_gauge_others_reactions_with_measured_risk
end
```

Over the last year I've gotten used to it, and, considering the legal precedent I knew I may be possibly setting, I was willing to take quite a bit of measured risk.

...

My manager Eloise was on vacation that week, where on monday I had a 1:1 to get to know a new coworker, Damon Hastings. Damon was around my age or a bit older, but newer to development as he made a career change in his late 20s. Damon was very nice and I thought he was smarter than his confidence allowed, though that can happen to minorities in tech quite often. Either way Damon seemed very happy at Vouch.

However, somehow Rachel Bird came up, and Damon, whom if I recall correctly was sitting with his wife in a diner at the time working via the diner's wifi, let me know an interesting detail that Eloise hadn't about Rachel Bird's time at Vouch.

Apparently Rachel had been sexually harassed by not one but two employees; and one was still present at the company.

I had gathered via her linked in profile that Rachel was also like Damon a developer via a career change, and was in her 40s. I immediately asked myself:

`Whom in this company would hit on a woman in her 40s and get away with it even though one guy didn't`

I immediately thought of John Wallace, who had a loserly vibe to me. I rethought the chain of event's from John Wallace's perspective, if and only if he was a dork ass divorced loser.

```
if vouch_cio_john_wallace_is_a_dork then
  if john_hit_on_and_got_rejected_by_rachel_bird then
    if rachel_saw_it_as_harassment_and_took_two_months off then
      if rachel_quit_on_a_friday then
        if john_took_personal_offense_to_his_masculine_identity then
          john_reacted_by_playing_dumb_spy_games_with_me_and_the_government
        end
      end
    end
  end
else if i_cannot_prove_all_of_the_above
  best_not_to_say_anything_about_it
else if cio_john_wallace_is_not_a_dork_ass_loser
  im_guessing_this_wouldnt_have_happened_but_idk_i_could_be_wrong
end
```

The only problem here was I couldn't prove any of that -- it would just make sense given other information at hand, so I just kept it in mind for down the road, saying to myself that if things got weirder, a 40 year old divorced tech executive's ego making this a reality makes more sense than not.

Damon seemed happily married with kids, and was from the Oakland area. I tried giving him shit for the Warriors, but I think he was a Kings' fan. About that, I could be mistaken.

...

Tuesday, March 1st, 2022, was probably the day everything got worse.

I didn't really know what was going on and knew I would be perceived as rude if I were to be direct about it; but something about the conflict in Ukraine persisting made me feel like whatever was happening, it was _wrong_, and it was worth finding out more about before I became the part that was wrong and not just the victim.

...

In 2020, I had developed a set of techniques meant to decipher if my bosses are paying attention to what I am saying while my laptop is on mute while working from home. It works alarmingly well during meetings, especially if you're decent at reading faces on web cams, as anyone who spent a good amount of time watching live video streams on Twitch would.

I had been streaming for 3 years at the time of 2020 when I combined the skill of knowing how to pay attention in meetings even if I am distracted or talking to someone else with the skill of being able to read faces when they're on webcams that I learned via twitch, with a skill I've always had but never had quite developed for this purpose: talking shit, to some extent, ala the children in the movie _Sandlot_, though hopefully with less gender bias.

By 2022, I worked for 3 separate companies that I could not identify as using audio surveillance after the company I worked for in 2020 where I developed my techniques and felt that I had confirmed they were surveilling me. The fourth company was Vouch, and the techniques never worked better in my life than on Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

In my most private of moments, I call the main technique, with some reference to the film _Perdita Durango_ and the Lady Gaga song _Poker Face_, the "Gandolfini Germanotta I Hate Your Little Poker Face Move." But only in private.

The "GG move" works thusly:

```
function the_gg_move
  if you_are_in_a_remote_meeting and you_can_hide_your_face_and_mute_your_mic then
    if you_start_talking_random_shit then
      if you_say_some_generally_wild_out_of_place_for_a_meeting_shit then
        if someone_flinches_or_laughs_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_refutes_the_current_speaker then
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_someone_in_another_state_says_moments_before_they_do
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          your_tech_boss_thinks_youre_a_hacker_despite_the_tech_reasons_this_is_dumb
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

function evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
  if they_flinched_while_looking_away_from_the_meeting_on_their_screen then
    theres_a_likelihood_your_audio_is_being_converted_to_text_in_a_separate_window
  end

  if their_energy_changes_in_no_recognition_to_actual_meeting then
    theres_a_likelihood_youve_stolen_their_focus_from_the_meeting_and_they_feel_caught
  end

  if they_seem_uncomfortable then
    they_likely_feel_guilty_or_self_conscious_about_privacy_implications
  else if they_seem_excited then
    they_likely_are_excited_about_a_context_to_invade_others_privacy
  end
end
```

Let's break these two methods down.

First is `the_gg_move`, the main method, the thing. In a tele conference meeting while working from home, if you can hide your camera and mute your mic while others do the opposite, you can find out based on other's reactions how they are audio surveilling you. You basically talk out loud to find out whether the hardware honors the software, or, whether there is a separate program running on your and some of your co worker's machines that monitors your audio and converts it to text in real time so they can know what you're saying, without you knowing it's running.

It's key to note that this would happen in a separate piece of software than your Zoom or Google hangout meeting, most likely, which is to say, if `the_gg_move` feels effective in a meeting, it's more than possible that your mic is not muted and is transcribing whatever it hears into text as often as you or anyone, even your television, speaks out loud around it.

_Is this thing on?_

That's the technical side at least. Welcome to the future. The age old side is more fun, to me. Depending on what _kind_ of shit you talk, you will get different reactions, that reveal different things, given the awkward and new-to-human-evolutionary-existence vibe the social situation you're in has.

I keep saying legal precedent for a reason. I'm a nurture over nature guy, fwiw.

The easiest is to just say wild shit, like you might at a party, but certainly not in relation to the meeting. Maybe jokes about someone. If you can make them laugh, try and do so. This is fun but I have never had it turn out well, to be honest, when I get reactions.

The reactions are usually flinches that - and this is crucial - _would not matter to the normal meeting at hand._ Meaning you _have got to_ pay attention to the meeting. You should be able to take notes after, you paid that much attention.

The interesting side effect about `the_gg_move` is that I end up paying way more attention during meetings, in a way that even if I had my web cam on and mic off mute, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be nearly as aware. Regardless, the purpose of `the_gg_move` is not to pay better attention during meetings.

The purpose of `the_gg_move` is to decipher to what extent your employer is utilizing digital audio surveillance on your devices while you work from home.

Anyway, if you talk wild shit, try and keep it funny, and you should get someone to laugh. The concept alone is funny, and many will get it - _this new employee is clearly trying to figure out if they're being audio surveilled by doing basic stand up comedy routines_ - just keep it as family friendly as possible and well, you should see someone laugh.

It helps to feel confident in being funny outside of this situation though, I'll allow.

The other thing is to _directly refute what is being said_. At times, the speaker will be a leader who has the audio surveillance text window open, and those reactions are the easiest to gauge. Did they lose their speaking cadence? Did they feel threatened?

Even if they didn't react themselves, this is still useful to gauge other people's reactions. At any rate it's important to try and keep your refutations in line with your own honest opinions, and it's _doubly_ important to, if they continue speaking and touch upon your complaint in a way that your complaint is no longer valid -- take the time to recognize that, actually, you were mistaken a moment ago.

You never know who's listening, but still, we all have disagreements on procedures at work places that we hold back in politeness. One way audio surveillance is not very polite, in my opinion, but it's a separate conflict from the one you're stirring up, so it's best to be clear when you're in the wrong, to deliver the best message.

After the flinch, in `evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard`, gauge their emotional state as best you can. Do they feel caught? Does this make them feel threatened, or excited? And finally, last, but not least, and basically generally applicable to any and every office situation:

Who are they and what do they mean to the company hierarchy?

I'd write that in the code but I figure'd it's obvious enough, just between us humans.

...

Vouch held company "all hands" meetings every Tuesday, meetings where the entire company gathered to hear updates from mostly leadership but also others within the company as well. You probably do something similar at your work place, if maybe at a different cadence. Vouch being a smallish, largely remote, under 100 employee company at the time, this was easy enough to do every week.

The first two weeks I mostly listened and didn't really run `the_gg_move`, but on that Tuesday, if I had roommates I'm sure they would have wondered why I was talking out loud while my speakers were clearly playing audio of my co workers speaking out loud in a meeting, and it sounds like we're having two separate conversations, albeit at times where it feels like both are listening to each other cautiously such to wonder if that group of people and or weird guy over there is listening to me or them, respectively.

But, I don't have room mates, and like I said, this isn't a normative human social situation; it's something new.

So anyway, March 1 2022 I was talking a lot of shit, refuting people at times, and getting a ton of reactions. I was pretty certain that at least the C levels were listening.

Not shocked given all that the last few weeks hinted at, I generally just kept talking.

At some point, I must've ran out of things to say. My more... base... human instincts must have caused me to react in such a way that I just starting saying, well, general things that would make sense in a casual way, without any real significance.

New employees just starting that week were being introduced. I soon saw a brown skinned man with a solid hair style on my screen. He took a moment to speak, which, gave me a pause to say something while being able to evaluate better if I was being listened to given there was no other stimuli to react to.

But, like I was saying, I think I ran out of things to say, so I just said something like

> "Alright then..."

I really can't remember other than that it was extremely... colloquial? And appropriate? For anyone in that situation, to say, really.

Three people shared the screen at the time, a google hangout managed whom showed up and who didn't based on previous speakers.

An HR person introducing the new employees was there, and the CEO Sam Hodges was also there as they had both spoken recently, and finally, the new brown skinned employee was on the screen.

The new guy spoke, and on my end, this was mere moments -- as a guy that considers game development and music hobbies, this may seem weird but -- maybe about 350 ms after I said what was quoted above, the new guy then began to speak:

> "Alright then..."

The HR person gave less reaction than the CEO, whom nearly choked on something they weren't eating at the moment if I recall. They both flinched, but one flinched way harder. The new guy didn't, and kept talking like things were normal, indicating only two were audio surveilling me.

I'll admit - it was kind of weird. I wondered if I was psychic. I realized if I was, I would've never taken this job.

My instinct was to accuse the flinchers of rascism, which, was stupid, and was just a way to talk random shit to buy time and gauge reactions while I considered what they _might_ think, and well, somewhere inside I sighed.

_They might think that somehow I "hacked" the meeting to know what he was going to say and that I'm showing off._

That's... impossible. I was in New York, I think taht guy was in the midwest, several people were spread across the country. I'd have to somehow be able to remotely delay the new guy's signal such that I could hear it first, fully interpret it, and then time everything appropriately, somehow. Without leaving a massive trail of evidence, if not working in tandem with several actors and at any rate... what kind of a person would do something like that?

To show off? What kind of a person capable of the above would just... show off with it?

Would these people _really_ think I'm some kind of Netflix inspired cartoon brought to life in human form, a television hallucination of a villain with magical hacking super powers?

_No, that's stupid. Surely, if they're flinching because this is some weird group investigation -- which, by the way, is weird! how many people know about this? the HR person?? -- then that means they'll eventually talk to actual technical folks who could explain that its impossible for me to do that, and maybe even just a few I don't know normal police detectives who might explain that I'd be a stupid criminal to do so and would've gotten caught on something long before I pulled off something so complex._

Or something, it was a trail of thoughts I had while calling people rascist for, well, reasons they weren't actually rascist for. It was a weird moment. The fact that the guy was brown, and had a solid hair style, two things I share with him, were in fact coincidences. At least at the time.

I'm _pretty_ sure I corrected myself on the rascist accusations, though, it wasn't the top most thing I tried to remember that day. I do remember attempting to address why I'm nor is anyone capable of "hacking" such to make that minor miracle happen. I didn't fully insinuate it was probably god doing it just to literally try and manufacture a situation where this shit gets so sideways somehow we never do it again while doing the least harm, but, mysterious ways get confused for technology in tech startups all the time - it's a big part of the financing structure!

Somewhat after that moment, while the HR person and the CEO were the only two people on the screen, the CEO, in a planned statement, reminded everyone of the company motto. That's to say I do not think he really thought of the motto in the context of audio surveilling an employee into a bogus federal investigation, but, he said what he said when he said something like:

> "When it comes to our employees at Vouch, we strive to live by the golden rule."

Near immediately, and in the hope that the audio transcription picked up my sudden falsetto, I responded directly:

> "You have me under audio surveillance!"

The HR person flinched and looked away, pain and shame in their eyes. I'm still not sure why they were involved to _that_ extent, given their lack of seniority within the company, but maybe given this new social situation, new expectations are arising for the average HR worker.

I'd recommend they watch _Burn Notice_, personally! But, maybe HR workers don't have to audio surveil the workforce in the future, that could be a thing too. It's a leap from making sure the company benefits package is properly executed, and I don't think there's much overlap in the trainings involved.

The CEO didn't flinch as much, but I saw his eyes tick to the side where I presume a chat window of some sort was transcribing my audio.

At some point, the CEO called on the CIO, John Wallace, directly. Wallace seemed a bit surprised -- this wasn't planned -- and appeared to shift his body to only show half of his face. I felt a bit of tension in the CEO when he called on John, as though he wanted to make a point that well, he was the leader, who could at any point call on anyone in the company and ask them to speak, even if they didn't plan it before.

Maybe the CEO was tense for other reasons. It just felt a bit competitive.

Either way, the CIO John Wallace answered the question as best he could, but in my opinion, while hiding half his face he also had an _excited_ cadence that didn't match up to what he was talking about entirely.

I began to wonder if my earlier suspicions about him could be true, but, to be honest, not that much.

_It's not like I could confirm at that moment that he literally got divorced recently, such to give him motivation to be gossipping about me in a way that led to a federal investigation such so he could feel dominant once again after potentially being rejected by a woman who recently quit._

Well, I still can't confirm _all_ of that, and at the time I coudln't confirm any of it, but it was a thought in my head, however fleeting.

I left the meeting feeling certain that, eventually, once these idiots found out I was joking, they'd fire me. I couldn't confirm that wouldn't happen at that point, but I can tell you that in the end, it was I who quit Vouch, and this meeting probably should have been when I did. Alas.

...

After that meeting, around an hour or two later, it was time to finally meet the C levels in a meeting that was cancelled two weeks ago.

I still wasn't _positive_ anything weird actually happened int he last all hands meeting that day. Maybe, I was just connecting odd occurences.

Only one way to find out, and I needed a break to relax. With about 15 minutes til the next meeting, I picked up my guitar and played. Thinking on it, it feels just like yesterday. I would've been better off getting on my knees and praying, but at least I didn't get fooled again.

Wait, who? Huh? No, no, I actually don't know enough of their songs.

I decided to play two songs by my laptop, that I had been practicing to some extent, while singing. I made some alterations to the lyrics of The Beatles' `Oh! Darling`, as well as David Bowie's `The Man Who Sold The World`, thinking the first could have a neat line about listening, and the second could really test out the theory of whether or not my bosses actually thought I was some kind of hacker that only exists in movies, such that I "sold the world", and can also play guitar, and sing, while looking insanely good doing it, _and_ specialize in a style of code that doesnt really involve hacking much?

I mean, it would have to be too much right? They'd... get it, right?

Maybe I should've also impressed them on my film knowledge.

Anyway, I had a cover of `Oh! Darling` I was working on about a fifth or a fourth down from where McCartney recorded it at. Pretty sure I pitched the Bowie song up a key. In the opening lines of `Oh! Darling`, I sang this, with some musical emphasis involving a quick drop out of my guitar.

> "Ohhh Darling.... if you're listening."

I think I may have growled a bit with the listening part. I was kind of pissed, sure, but, I was also in character! Also the song involves a lot of oxygen so I think I got caught in two places. But I digress, the song continues

> "I will never do you no harm... believe me when I tell you... I will never do you no harm"

Which, fuck me, I thought might be a cute way to say I'm not doing you any harm you dumb weird fucking people. Without the last bit.

I kept the lyrics to the Bowie song straight forward.

I'm not... bad... at guitar. I'm not a great singer. But I can sing, not well, and play somewhat complicated riffs at the same time. I'm not like, John Mayer or something, but I also don't practice. I remember being fairly artful with my arrangement of `The Man Who Sold The World` and, based on the meeting, I wondered if they hypothesized there were two people in the room, as I couldn't confirm as video surveillance was occurring?

I probably could've picked a simpler song, like `My Generation` maybe, but hopefully there's never a next time.

Anyway, if they thought I was more than one person, even just that day, it's one of the better explanations as to why 3 out of the 4 C levels present in the earlier day's all hands meeting would miss the meeting specifically meant to introduce themselves as leaders of a small company to incoming employees, especially a meeting that was cancelled in it's first week and thus representing not just one but two whole batches of new employees.

It also explains why the one C level "thrown to the wolf" was the youngest, Travis Hedge, someone with a family legacy in the insurance industry and along with the CEO a co founder of Vouch. I had met with him in a previous onbaording meeting and had some back and forth dialogue; I thought he was an ok guy and after hearing him talk in that and other meetings, I had established a baseline for his cadence.

It wasn't to be redder in the face than a tomato in the sun, at least for a paleish white guy, who wasn't normally so flush.

I think he may have seen me recognize that, and immediately offered that his wife was locked outside his house and he just had to run to get the door.

He took a moment and I thought _that's a pretty solid way to explain why you're gonna be red in the face on the way back, but not at the start of this meeting, but, yeah_.

When he was back he was a bit short in breath in a way he wasn't at the start of the meeting, something that didn't suprise me.

I handled the meeting normally, camera and mic recording me for the rest of the group. I was patient and eventually engaged Travis, the sole C level present, in light conversation, mostly to ease his tension, and in the format of easy softball "hey what's this company do" questions that may be helpful for the whole group to hear.

Mostly so he could calm down and stop being so red in the face, which he did quickly.

I wish the other C levels had shown; I think they felt ashamed at not doing so given how differently I handle, well, being in meetings where I consent to being seen and heard.

...

That evening, I continued my fourth re watch of the Anime classic _Death Note_. I'm sorry if that's lame to you, or if you don't know what that is.

(nts: check text and notes) At around 7:30 PM that evening, right when I was habitually "signing off" after work, my internet went down again, and I was streaming via Netflix at the time, to my present day dismay (I now prefer the disc format). The last time it went down, it was at the start of my workday. Now the opposite.

I expressed annoyance to my laptop, saying this was lame, or something to that extent. I felt more hassled than harrassed at that moment, but the law is grey on such things I suppose.

In 5 minutes or so, my internet connection came back on, though Spectrum took an hour to text me about it while telling me immediately when it went down.

I didn't care, I just went back to _Death Note_.

At some point soon I couldn't focus -- the show involves police and, well, my life probably did at that point in some way as well. I realized it was probably time to do the one thing I hadn't done, on purpose.

I really wanted Vouch to be a place where I could _ignore_ their ineffeciencies, which abound in big tech, in order to pay my debts and balance my life out a bit. That didn't turn out to be possible. However, in that effort, when joining I astutely did absolutely zero research on the "company leadership."

All I knew about them before joining was that the one CFO from another company whose offer I declined seemed impressed enough by Vouch's CEO, which spoke highly to me.

_So who are my bosses anyway?_

To LinkedIn I went. I'm pretty sure I remember the order. I at least remember looking at the CEO near last, which, emotionally, was a big mistake.

First was the youngest and the one I had seen the most recently, Travis Hedge. He had recently lost weight, and had a bit of a career gap, and I'm pretty sure came from a family with a background in business insurance, but other than confirming he was midwestern, that was it on him. His career was less impressive than the rest of the board's, but the family lineage probably helped to make him a co founder with Hodges. I don't think he had much but some backgruond in "tech", likely due to his youth.

Next was my boss' boss, Rajat Kongovi. He had much previous experience in tech and Ivy League credentials. I think he played basketball in college. I imagined him being the guy on the board that made the older whiter guys feel cool, as Rajat felt a lot more relaxed than others. Call me rascist, it's fine, I do it all the time. Rajat had a very if not the most impressive resume of anyone on the C suite, particularly with regards to tech and business leadership, but nothing of interest to me in relation to my situation.

Next was the CIO, John Wallace. He had a deep legacy in business insurance and other types of things, but none in tech, this appeared to be his first gig there. I noted it seemed like he grew up or went ot college in the Colorado area, lived in Wisconsin for sometime, then recently moved to Chicago, right where Vouch had an office. Nothing else worth seeing, though, I did laugh out loud when I saw his profile picture, just in case they were listening. In honesty, it was a fine picture.

Finally, at least to my memory, was the CEO, Sam Hodges. Sam had an insanely long linked in profile. There were several long stints as company leadership of all kinds, much in the sector of tech venture capital, and much to be said as a CEO - it wasn't his first time. But there were also board appointments - oh the board appointments! I remember scrolling quite a bit before I saw this:

```
Trade Finance Advisory Council Member
U.S. Department of Commerce
Oct 2016 - Sep 20182 years

Washington D.C. Metro Area

Appointed by Secretary Pritzker to serve a two-year term on the Trade Finance Advisory Council, which advises the Secretary and executive staff on the development of strategies and programs that help expand access to trade finance for U.S. exporters.
```

I've checked recently, I think he's slimmed down some of the information.

That said, apparently my boss' boss' boss, the CEO, was formerly a part of the Obama administration by way of an appointment via Secretary Penny Pritzker.

I'd be proud of Sam if I were his parents, I really would. But I'm not, and I was pretty sure this had something to do with my suspicions about everything being federally involved.

I sighed, but kept checking, and saw something else - that he graduated from Brown University.

At the time he didnt' list the date of graduation, but if referring to when his internships ended and his first signs of employment started, it seemed to me like he could have attended Brown Univesity somewhere between the years of 1999 and 2003.

My sister, to whom I'm estranged from and have been for the last three or five years at least, attended Brown University between the years 1999 and 2003.

My sister, given a quick linked in check, was at the time of my employment at Vouch, a DEI officer of the 9th district federal court of the US, and was at one point an employee of the US EOC, or Equal Opportunity Commission.

And here I am, a brown guy getting his internet cut because he rocked out to some white guys's tunes too hard, but I ain't ever worked for no government.

Reader, if you were wondering - didn't any of this make you feel awful, as well as suspicious, and paranoid, and just generally unwell?

Well, a little, but not a lot. Until that point. I started to feel awful then, but in a familiar way that perhaps had less to do with my feelings on government overreach and more to do on my feelings about my family's feelings on me.

But I'll let you know about all that later on in the memoir.

That was Tuesday evening, March 1st, 2022. I still had work in the morning.


# Chapter 6 - Third Week at Vouch, 3/2 on

> "You ever meet someone, and it just seems to click instantly? You like the same things, share the same opinions - it seems lke you've known them your whole life. It could be fate, or it could be that you have a listening device planted under the dashbaord of your car." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Wednesday at work was fairly normal. I had code to look at, so I looked. There were some other meetings that didn't feel too weird.

However, in my apartment in New York City, on the edge of the East River, and a street away from the FDR underpass, something strange started happening.

The underpass below the FDR, directly across the street from me and the easiest thing to view that's not the river itself once you exit the building, has three sections. On the left is the FDNY section, which is used primarily for EMS vehicles. During the 2020 COVID lockdown, it was busy moving the sick and the dead. On the right is a DSNY section, which also I believe houses a maintanence crew for city vehicles in general, but mostly sanitation cars moved in that area.

In the middle was an unmarked area. Later in 2020 during the George Floyd protests, this area was flooded with unmarked vans. I'm pretty sure it's for the cops.

About 6 or 7 years ago, it was empty under there. You could even park if you had a car and nothing would be there to stop you.

In 2022, starting to my recollection on March 2nd 2022, I started to see something that became a regular theme over the next few weeks and into the spring: rental cars, primarily but not entirely focused on parking in the "middle" section.

I've seen cop cars park there, sometimes. Unmarked vehicles, often. But rental cars have a... "I was just cleaned" look to them.

I sighed and figure'd that last night's research couldn't have been too far off: _only out of towners would rent cars, and only law enforcement should be able to park in that area, and only out of town law enforcement would focus on renting mostly black, american vehicles given domestic discounts._

And, if I was wrong, well, then nothing else weird would happen.

...

Thursday, the new guy whom I had shared words with though we never spoke, shared his bio with the rest of the company, as did all the other new employees that week.

Almost magically, he would fill out the rest of the band I'm not in - he played drums and bass. Wow. I play guitar and sing! And we're both brown guys!

... did they think we'd be friends?

Under more normal circumstances, I may have reached out and said something. But he wasn't in my department, nor a programmer of any kind, so we had no real context to talk about those things, though I had with other employees in my department.

Normally I wouldn't pay attention to any of that being a sign of subterfuge _just because the guy's brown skinned and I am to_... but I did begin to wonder if the CEO flinched as hard as he did because yes, the guy was hired here to try and "feel me out."

I forget his name, but weeks later I would look him up on linked in as well. Apparently, he went to college with the company's head of security, a young man named Cody who was hired shortly before I was and seemed to have a background in "digital security." I also noted the new guy's resume had little to say about business insurance, and seemed fairly entry level.

Did the newly hired digital security guy ask his one college buddy to join a company and play up a musical inclination to... feel me out?

It'd be weird if so.

But I've also never seen a CEO with such a stellar reputation flinch as hard at anything as I saw Hodges flinch two days ago.

It's probably just a coicidence.

...

March is, of course, women's history month, and Vouch was not going to let that one slide. On Thursday, there was an optional meeting that, had I more work to do, I probably would have politely tried to avoid, focused on celebrating the month.

I've come a long way with regards to the whole "politics at work" thing -- yes, I wish communicating to people about my politics caused effective change, but I think we really tried that a bit too much with the social media and we should all dial back a bit ~~before we go insane as a society in such a way that normal people like me feel like we're in a zombie movie where we can't just behead our problems away due to the zombie class' elevated police state~~, but that's just my opinion.

I also hate meetings, and feel that all too often, people work past the hour when they should be going home.

Less bullshit, less meetings, more going home on time and a trend towards workplace efficieny over emoji likes would be nice, but again, I'm at a tech startup.

I go to the meeting. I don't want to appear sexist, certainly not in this situation. I keep my camera on and my mic as well, I doubt I said anything though I certainly had some thoughts.

There was a light presentation given by an HR person enthusiastically describing the Stonewall Riot, commemorating a 1969 conflict in NYC between the cops and the LGBTQ+ members of the community at a bar. Very progressive for a company on women's history month, though, I do wonder how a business insurance company would actually react to broken windows and situations involving police riots, despite the politics.

At some point the larger meeting, which had 40 or so people, was broken up into smaller "breakout" sessions, where about 5 or so would gather to have a more close knit conversation.

A white woman with dyed black curly hair in her late 40s was in my group. She seemed nice, and I can't remember the exact topic of our breakout -- I'd imagine it had to do with women, being a meeting on women's history month. For some reason, this woman, in response to something completely unconnected, brought up the Sandanistas a few times. Perhaps she was Nicaraguan, though I can't remember, I just remember thinking _how in gods name did you find a segway to bring up the Sandanistas at a women's history month meeting?_

I sighed. I remembered that, if you did a "background check" on me past the usual information, you might find I tried to start a game project which did involve, yes, people who call themselves words that get grouped into a political grouping that yes, may include the Sandanistas.

Does that mean that's my politics? I don't even agree with political groupings. Like I said I think you nutbags are all zombies. What's that? I didn't say that? Hmm.

Anyway, that someone may be "checking me out" for "latent signs of" the "notion to speak on radical politics in the work place" -- I'm at a point in my life where I regret going to work on election days, just to avoid conversation. It took me awhile, like I said. So I wasn't worried.

But, a thought: _Jesus christ, every C level being aware I get, an HR person in their 20s is kind of unprofessional, but who is this random white woman who seems super interested in proving that Rachel Maddow was right about me all along, even though Ms. Maddow and I don't know each other?_

If you haven't picked up by now, I have a figurative thought process.

I'm polite, and try and get out of that meeting saying as little as I can while keeping the camera on and the mic off mute.

...

Later in the day and after the diversity meeting, I see a chat room focused on women's history month. I take a look but I don't join, not wanting to stir anything up.

Many have spoken on the month -- most of the women in the company, and all of the c levels. There's a lot of chat to scroll through.

A new C level, Rukmini Banerjee, seemed to be making her presence known by setting up a prompt:

> "For women's history month, I thought it'd be great if we could all name a woman we find influential."

Or something to that extent. Rukmini had just joined around when I had, and I hadn't seen her in any all hands meetings. Perhaps I would have, had I not quit.

Dozens of responses included photos and links, references to women of note, women in people's families, and women of note in people's families.

I recall seeing the CEO refer to his grandmother, whom was a scientist.

I almost lost my shit when I saw John Wallace, the CIO, and what he had typed. I had already noticed in another google doc he seemed to have trouble with his spelling and grammar. That's fine - we all do here and there - but it's atypical for a C level who is a native to an english speaking country, and I had seen quite a few lapses on his part already. But, given the prompt, and the setting, I was pretty suprised to see him start a sentence thusly:

> "It's hard not to lose at so many woman, but if I had to choose..."

He went on to discuss his mother, who was a diver, and the time she dove while wearing all her clothes at a party.

Now, the... way one could read into the phrasing is a subject I'll leave up to you reader, that isn't nearly as important as simply recognizing that, yes, that is a sentence that one doesn't just read, they read _into_ it.

It's just funny that, seeing as how hours past and dozens of people contributed underneath that message, CIO Wallace would've had the opportunity to, well, edit it. It's obvious he meant "it's hard to lose given so many great women out there", or some such shit, and if he edited it, that's what it woudl say, and only whoever read it the first time would ever have to think about the word "projection."

It also meant that no one on the C level, nor any of his subordinates were willing to or could convince him, in a separate DM, to change the sentence, for the obvious implications that it seems he's saying women are a thing to compete over, along with the singular where there should be a plural issue.

Or, he's just not the kind of guy that wants to be known for editing his mis phrasings.

I felt, weird about it, but moved on. I had that earlier feeling that he may be a dork ass loser, and I think I was right.

...

I have another 1:1 with a developer, this time outside of my team but within my department. She was younger than I, seemed very smart, we got along quickly with regards to technical things. At one point, I asked her a question with regards to the database they were using. For those that are technical, I asked if the company considered using NoSQL at some point, even in the format of a Json column, in order to deal with different "versions" of insurance plans that may be dynamic in structure between various clients. They seemed to be undergoing a project that woudl take a lot of work via individual migrations where versioning documents may make more sense and serve as a better parallel for insurance clients -- but this was in my opinion.

She seemed a bit taken aback and commented that she had made the same suggestion but was brushed off.

Now, I don't know the full technical details -- this was a "rails" backend, and often, rails developers want to stick to idioms that are more structured than NoSQL. Pardon the tech jargon - that's just to say she and I could have both been wrong but, given the way she let me know, I began to wonder, against all the other things I had experienced, whether Vouch was a company dealing with internal bigotry more than it's CEO, a former Obama apointee, might want to be known for.

It'd make a lot of sense considering I thoguht I was under investigation for crimes I hadn't committed nor really existed such that at least _someone else_ did the stuff they were investigating me for. I mean, maybe, but they never todl me why they were investigating me, if they were. Anyway.

It's just to say, I could misread her and projected my own thoughts. But I kept them to myself and replied by saying that maybe the datbase thing had somethign to do with resource management or scheduling, and, it probably did.

...

Friday came and wasn't terribly eventful. However, looking out my window, I kept seeing a rotation of rental cars. There seemed to be more and more. Some even seemed to bulge a bit. It's obvious I've watched a lot of _Burn Notice_, but sometimes armoring a car woudl mean putting things "under" the normal areas such that they jut out a bit. I could have been seeing things but then I started to ask myself...

If this was the FBI, they wouldn't rent cars -- they have a field office in Manhattan at least. Neither would the NYPD.

The CIA doesn't technically have jurisdiction Stateside. Sort of, but this probably wasn't a them thing. The DHS seemed unlikely as well.

I think I looked up at that moment to be sure of something I wasn't 100% on: technically speaking, who does the digital crimes thing, federally at least?

There wasn't a clear answer, but one of them was the Secret Service, but moreso, it really could've been... well... all of them. But the Secret Service would probably be the DC oriented folks that have the most connections with the NYPD, explaining the rental cars as well as the location.

Like I said before, I have a figurative brain, and it flashed for a second.

In programming, a linked list is a set of data structures where one links to another.

A thought process can feel like one at times, if you hear all your thoughts.

> OK. So this could be the White House.
>
> OK. So my boss' boss' boss used to, in some way, work for a former White House admin.
>
> OK. So my sister may have gone to college with my boss' boss' boss.
>
> OK. So my sister works in a federal court in California and lives in Los Angeles.
>
> OK. Wait, this could be the White House? Which one?
>
> Oh. The White House admin with a VP who used to represent California, where your sister lives.
>
> Oh. The White House admin with a VP who is half the nationality you and your sister are.
>
> Oh. The White House admin that is pushing DEI, and your sister is a DEI officer
>
> Oh. Oh. Oh.
>
> Well, my sister had political ambitions, maybe, but moreso she had ambitions as an actor. As long as this isn't some Netflix show, maybe Ill be fine.

Your brain can think some crazy things. You can't prove them for truth. I remember thinking the above and thinking, man, that'd be crazy. And fucked up. And it'd only be true if, well, somehow this thing continues in a way to prove that those connections matter more than the law which was being utilized to investigate me.

But, given it was DC, I'd probably never be able to prove it. Well, not alone at least.
# Pt 1 Ch 7 - Fifth Week at Vouch, 3/6/22 -- Eyes in the back of my mind

### Draft

> "Figuring out if a car is tailing you is mostly about driving like you're an idiot. You speed up, slow down, signal one way, turn the other. Of course, ideally, you're doing this without your mother in the car." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from USA Network's _Burn Notice_

I honestly wasn't sure what was more dissapointing with Vouch: that they had "woopsie-daisied" their way into putting me under what felt like a federal investigation of some sort, or that they told half the damn company that I was under some kind of investigation like it was gossip, and asked them to try and "trigger" me in meetings to see how I'd respond to things like the "Sandanistas."

I supposed I'd have to deal with the latter more than the former, though that changed this week.

...

That week I skipped the company all hand's on purpose. I felt I had caused too much a scene between that and the other meeting the previous week. A few hours before, I told my manager I'd be absent in the afternoon, making up the excuse of a doctor's appointment. Outside of meetings, I said to my laptop outloud:

> "Look, I think we can all use a break. I'm going for a walk during the meeting, I'll be back online in the afternoon."

No point in lying to people surveilling you about a doctor's appointment that doesn't exist after all.

I, like many, feel safer when I have some amount of cash with me. I, at the time, had little to none, so I made a plan to take a long winding walk to the ATM, something that's normal to me. I work at a computer usually, so I need to find ways to move around here and there.

In the introdution of this memoir, I speak of an incident that would happen in the future with regards to feeling followed as well as setup.

That day was my first of getting used to such feelings, but even in comparison, it felt more childish in ways.

On my walk, I could identify three groups of people, with two different groups of behaviors.

Behaviors:
1. Setting up in positions ahead of where I was going -- I walk slowly, this is easier done than said in a city like New York given a handful of folks and surveillance equipment -- such to "eye me", maybe to see if they recognized me or something.
1. Trying to get my attention sexually -- generally this was women but one man acted peculiarly in a way I usually identiy as someone trying to get me to check them out. Hey, it happens, but I'm not that good looking, and that day especially, I was less so. It also wasn't a nice day -- it was just about 55' but very gray, warm for March maybe, and some people were wearing nice outfits, but many of the ladies I saw were wearing clothes that wouldn't make sense for mid week in a not that touristy section of downtown.

Groups of people:
1. One group felt like undercover NYPD -- they had clothes that looked more worn than not
1. Another group felt like undercover Feds of various sorts -- they had clothes that were recently bought, and some of them dressed younger than their ages, likely on purpose for the occasion
1. The final group felt like Federal "hackers" asked to see if they recognized me -- they looked like typical computer nerds, save for the fact that when I made them, it appeared like they'd glance around for their security person, one of the above at times.

I made a dropbox video where I record myself using google maps and describing each othe locations where I felt suspicious of osmeone, describing their outfits and cadences. I'm going to avoid being so exhaustive here and just speak on the most interesting chain of events; as I was walking home.

I should be clear: were all this to happen and none of the previous events, particularly the vehicles I'd never seen before start parking across the street, well, I'd probably just assume I was looking good, or maybe walking with good posture or, just, had it going on for some reason in a drab outfit, unshowered, with my hair in many places at once, shaven as though I wanted someone from the early aughts to pop out of a time machine and accuse me of terrorism based on my unkempt beard.

I mean, it's happened before, sometimes people are into that sort of thing.

But on that day, when I felt numerous accounts of those behaviors, I felt certain of the groupings being more possible as well.

...

I could be wrong, but when I want to I have a great memory, so I made sure to remember as much as I could, taking the time to walk indirectly, zig zag across the street, speed up, slow down, and make as many excuses to gather my surroundings as possible.

I really don't know how that came off to everyone watching me. Maybe I should have thought about that a bit more.

Either way, I eventually come to a tight street in Chinatown on my way home. As I'm crossing, I see to my left a group of 3 young women crossing perpendiculurly in my direction, such that if I kept at the same pace, I'd likely collide. I didn't feel like slowing down, so I sped up instead and looked downwards, cutting off my peripheral vision in a way most other pedestrians might notice as I come into their vision, forcing them to slow down if and only if I haven't sped up enough. You can call it a bit rude if you want. I learned it walking around Chinatown and seeing old people do it, so I don't care.

I never said I was a role model.

The downside of cutting off your peripherals by looking down is you also can't see ahead of you; the three young woman must have sped up, and I assume specifically to be ahead of me or get betwixt me. I slow down in response and allow them to move forward with their new pace; they turn the corner so they are now in front of me instead of crossing. I'm not sure at that point if they're involved in my situation, but I'm wary of the three young women who are dressed like tourists or perhaps college students in the way most would be given the above.

As they walk further down the street, I see an older hispanic man sweeping outside a storefront with a broom, and he makes the time to near comically bug his eyes out at the three young girls such that, well, anyone like me some 20-30 ft away could see he thought those three young girls were worth becoming a human Warner Bros. cartoon over.

I may be getting ahead of myself on that last one, but I digress.

The young ladies cross the street shortly after the broom sweeper turns his head to see them pass. As they do, one looks back and takes the time to make eye contact with me. If it weren't for the broom guy, I might've felt flattered.

_I think they want me to follow them into some store, to start a conversation of some sort, likely for the reasons of general entrapment. It's not even that I'm aware of that -- I just don't want to follow three strange people into a store just to start a conversation because they looked at me._

Either way -- wether I was aware of being under a bogus Federal Investigation gone wrong or not -- reader, I would not have walked into that store for the reasons above. It's just not a me thing to do. What am I gonna say? "Hey, I was following you and you looked entertaining so now we're here. Hi!" Maybe it works for other people, but it's just not a very me thing.

I did something I may not have done had I not been paranoid about my workplace fooling with the government to make fools of themselves -- I sighed. Then I did the normal thing and kept walking.

I cross further down the block and I see a man ahead of me on the same side, about 25 feet ahead. He's a bit taller than me and athletic, wearing a light shade of pants. I noticed him because he was walking the way people walk to caricature gay men. I assume he was straight as a result, but that's not what I was thinking.

_Oh. These weirdos want to figure out my sexuality. They're wondering why I didn't follow the three young girls into a store and they took the time to plan that one, maybe. This is a quick decision made in light of that, and kind of childish at that. I can imagine a lot of people on headphones watching cameras in vans like this was a TV show, or kind of like Chris Penn rest in peace and Tom Sizemore's characters_ -- this thought was prior to his passing so rest in peace as well and best wishes to both Penn and Sizemore's families -- _in one of my favorite movies_ True Romance _well, I'd rather the cops or whomeever have fun with this. It would be easier to gain their sympathies that way to make sure I don't get framed later on, even if this is kind of immature in my opinion._

That said, another thought came into my head:

_But I could be wrong. How could I prove that I wasn't?_

I figure'd if this guy was doing this on behalf of an investigation, and he had support, and was trying to figure out if I was comically gay instead of comically straight, then a lot of people are watching.

So I deliberately picked up my pace. In my head, I made a plan to run past him to see what would happen.

I put my first foot down with a slightly higher pace. My second foot is in the air and his asscheecks all of a sudden drop a similar distance from their position of... whatever he was doing to however he would normally walk.

I continue to walk faster and he picks up his pace just a bit, glancing to his right at I presume a rear view mirror.

Just a few more steps before I could break out into a jog, a man I mostly call "buttcheeks" in my head does one of the coolest things I think I've ever seen.

To this day, it was probably the coolest thing any of these clowns pulled off.

As a white van comes down the street to my right, buttcheeks darts in front of it. It cuts of my vision as I assume he ran across the street.

I never even got to a jog -- after barely a few steps at a higher pace, the van passed, and I looked down the corner and across the street --

No sign of buttcheeks.

He couldn't of gotten in the van; it was moving too fast. I honestly don't know where he went.

So when I say I think of a man who was likely an undercover NYPD based on the wear in his clothing as "buttcheeks" -- don't you dare say I think less of him for it.

...

As I got home I crossed South St. for little reason other than to check out the water a bit before going home. I was taking a break from work, after all.

A shiny clean, boxy, older style Mercedes Benz sedan pulls up as I cross. I have the light so I'm not worried but it makes a quick move to meet me on the street; without the light, and maybe in another part of the city, I may have stopped.

In these moments, I like to give a light "look" to the driver so they know it's probably not the best place to do that; without saying any words. Sometimes out of towners pull off the FDR and think it's still Jersey, it happens.

That said, the shiny Benz has a driver that seems equally willing to give me a look; even if it's more of a lean-past-the-wheel-because-Im-older-and-itd-be-easier-to-see-you-closely kind of look.

I'm 37; sometimes I gotta do it too, but the guy was in his 50s. To me his haircut screamed Fed, but his loose fitting track outfit screamed TV mob guy; especially with the Benz.

Again, I wouldn't have considered him anything other than an oddity of culture -- being a brown guy who grew up in Jersey then lived in New York makes me one in some ways -- but given how funny the walk felt otherwise, I remember I had the thought:

_Wait are these people stupid enough to think that I really thought it was the mob and now they're dressing up to see how I'd react to something like that? How much TV do they watch? Does the NSA really not know I haven't even seen the Godfather series yet? What kind of fascism is this?_

Also another thought:

_My tax dollars deserve better than this. Maybe even other people's too._


...

One thing I hadn't thought about was Cryptocurrency. Other than working for a single company in athat industry in a career that's seen employ at dozens of other non Crypto firms, it wasn't really a big part of my life.

I've had regrets. Many of us have. I could have been a millionaire etc.

Over a decade ago I gave my buddy some cash that he turned into Crypto ~~so he could buy acid~~ but we liquidated it too quickly to see it as investment.

That said I've never spent one US Penny of mine on a Crypto currency, and I'll keep that at that.

It's a very popular thing to do these days, however.

A month before, on February 8th, 2022, the US Justice Department arrested a couple for laundering money via crypto currency, seizing more than $3.5 billion in assets along the way, the largest financial seizure ever.

On February 12th, 2022, Netflix ordered a docuseries on the couple.

I share nothing in common wiht that couple, save for a few things:

1. They were living blocks away from where I lived and worked in the financial district at the time.
1. I think I'm funnier but yes one of them has put out content under the identity "Razzlekhan," referring to herself as the "Crocodile of Wall st", and is a, well, "character", like I am aware I can be.
1. Razzlekhan is a musician and puts out music under that name, as well, I was just hoping to maybe do with a guitar and some like 90s cover songs, a totally different style if you ask me, but whatever

Reader, in 2023, I'm pretty sure we were both under a federal investigation due to the fact that I share the three things above, this has been revealed via audio surveillance to my company whom unbenknownst to me may have connections with the federal government, who is more than likely being interviewed right that moment by Netflix for the Razzlekahn thing.

But I have never, not once, spent a dime on crypto currency. I've never committed financial fraud.

I'm not a criminal.

But I am a kooky person.

_What kind of fascism is this?_ is a thought I frequently have; though, I wouldn't google for the keywords "netflix cryptocurrency series" until about December that year of 2022, when 9 months later I finally realized I needed more answers than these people apparently needed to leave my life.

Either way, had I known society's true crime fascination was overlapping with a digital fraud case of historic proportions that centered around the social media habits of the criminal, well, I probably wouldn't have acted the way I did.

But, I was acting. When Razzlekhan committed crimes they weren't, and that will always be the difference between them and me.

But we are both kooky people.

_What kind of fascism is this?_

Oh, reader, I should mention, `the_gg_move`, the one I said I picked up in 2020?

It was during my one stint in the crypto currency industry.

You might've figure'd that one out on your own -- I don't really need to say much more about that experience for you to get the rest.

_What kind of fascism is this?_
# Pt 1 Ch 8 - A break to describe the Biden / Harris admin's motivations against me and potential relationships with Netflix and my employer Vouch

> "They spent time retweeting my posts and calling me a white supremacist, a coon and all sorts of derogatory names, fueling others who began to DM me telling me I was a sell out because I was Black and I should’ve killed myself when I had the chance," Jeffrey said. "I was mocked and harassed for being a sexual assault survivor, a domestic abuse survivor, and was told by the KHive that it was good for me and they hope it happens again, since I don’t support Harris." - Luverta Jeffrey, former black female Kamala Harris supporter, as quoted in the [huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-khive-toxic-side_n_5f4fa573c5b69eb5c037473e)

I joined Facebook a year after it was made and my first year before college, 2004. It was funny; I made a long joke name for myself that was funny. At some point early on, I met someone who said "oh, you're that person with the funny name on facebook." They were being honest, they thought it was funny too.

But I felt funny in a different way -- _you know me for that, but I'm right here, that's weird_ -- I look back on it as the first time I felt like I could do without social media. I quit I believe for the first time in 2007, and then several times until around perhaps the 2010s when if I signed on, it would have been for professional web development purposes only.

Things like twitter or instagram never really "hooked" me, and again, I had latent fascinations like many people that passed until, well, I needed to use their APIs for some job as a web developer.

Reader, I am not like everyone else in society as a result. I began to realize this in 2017, but moreso in 2020, as I re-engaged with social media.

From 2017-2020, most of my focus was on game development, in an explicit attempt to avoid the real world, which didn't last, and was rather hard to avoid given the "trending" nature of social media and our own society.

By 2020, I decided to uptick my sporadic social media status and attempt to parlay the "social media left", a group of people largely identifying as Bernie Sanders supporters, into a way to prove an entrepreunerial idea of mine tying video games to charity and support systems outside of the video game itself. The kids seemed to dig it, and I thought it was a great way to keep the energy that Sanders' primary campaign built up, but after he had stepped out of the primary.

What I wasn't prepared for was the duality of society that social media has introduced -- followers are nice, likes are special, and going viral is the goal -- but between all of that, if you can shit on someone else and feel like you're better than them, then social media will make that available to you.

I left the social media left in 2021 feeling that this toxicity was apolitical; it had nothing to do with politics, and it had eveyrthing to do with a pursuit of fame I coudln't understand.

Reader, I believe that toxicity and pursuit of fame that social media has come to define, one in which I was unaware of until 2020 in terms of degrees, has absolutely infilitrated the psychology of the Biden / Harris administration to the point where practical politics is impossible as they are spending time, tax dollars, and DNC assets in an attempt to become Netflix famous by smearing their political opponents -- even and especially when thyr'e private citizens, and then the Biden / Harris administration feels like they can use the law to smear them.

Pure fascism has come to America, and it wants to be televised.

...

Reader, here are the reasons I am suspicious that the DNC, led by the Biden / Harris admin and the "KHive", has since at most January 2022 been targeting me via the mechanism of a Netflix show formerly based on the hope that I would be connected to the behaviors of the Razzlekhan folks.

1. *Vouch introduces me to the Biden Harris DOJ and intelligence services in an attempt to position themselves as better cyber insurance experts*

When joining Vouch, it was made clear in several meetings as well as the code base that they were figuring out how to separately "price" something they were calling cyber insurance, which seemed new to them and referred to the growing network of activity in the Cryptocurrency network, I believe.

In late January or possibly sometime in February to March 2022, I believe Vouch reached out to the Federal Government via their CEO Sam Hodges' connections, hoping that I would be a "cyber criminal" as long as they could treat me like less of a human being than most new employees.

At this point, I believe that Vouch, the Biden Harris DOJ, members of the Federal intelligence services, Netflix, and possibly representatives of the NYPD related to the Razzlekhan case all overlapped. If Vouch was aggressive in painting me as a criminal at this time despite the lack of evidence, their motivation aside from fame may have been to better "price" cyber insurance.

Perhaps they've learned a lesson about pricing utility against pure fantasy.

2. *Guilty by association to KHive enemies on social media*

In 2020, I attempted to raise funds for COVID 19 and Climate Change by organizing -- after the Democratic primary -- a small group of mostly Sanders supporters who had varied degrees of "internet fame" in representing a group of nearly 3 dozen "e-celebs" I'll refer to from here on as the "social media left" -- I had no true following before or after this, but I was able to get the attention of many of the social media left given the idea. 

The idea was to simultaenousely raise money as well as crowd fund a video game whose intent would be to continue to raise money for various groups and charities. I began on the "social media left" feeling that the lack of an active campaign would be a good segway, though I had, due to a lack of experience, underestimated the "social" aspects, particularly the toxic ones, that take place on social media, and abandoned the project in 2021.

It was of minor note then but I was suspicious at the time of possible DNC sabateouring from within the people I was working with, though again, I thought little of this beyond paranoia at the time.

3. *Me To Vouch to Sam Hodges to Biden Harris DOJ to Razzlekhan to Netflix to Obama*

In the beggining of 2022, major Democratic donor Netflix's CEO was Reed Hastings. Per the NYT:

> "Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, also ranked among the largest donors to Future Forward, a Democratic-aligned super PAC that reportedly spent over (00 million in support of President-elect Biden.)" [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/future-forward-super-pac.html) via [Infleunce Watch](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/reed-hastings/#:~:text=Hastings%20and%20Quillin%20were%20among,Warnock%20(D%2DGA).)

Netflix also had several contractual relationships with former President Barack Obama's "Higher Ground" productions company, offering several ways the center right DNC wing led by the Biden / Harris administration in the White house and Barack Obama outside of it a way to connect directly with Netflix.

The CEO at Vouch where I worked at the time was Sam Hodges, formerly appointed to the Obama / Biden administration via the Secretary of Commerce, giving him a slight but definitive connection to the current POTUS as well as former POTUS Obama.

This connected me, via Vouch, to Sam Hodges, who was connected to the Obama / Biden admin, where Obama has active connections to Netflix, all while Razzlekhan had just been arrested by the Biden / Harris DOJ in 2022 and made into a Netflix special.

4. *My video game named in late 2018 and a book that came out two years later*

I came up with the idea for the video game mentioned before in late 2018, and called it _The Promised Land_ largely out of difficulty thinking of anything else and wanting to focus on the programming moreso at the time. I was also listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen, someone who at the time was I believe making a podcast with the former President Barack Obama.

In late 2020, after connecting with several of the "social media left", I was somewhat surpised to see Obama had named his latest book _A Promised Land_ and privately mused that it woudl be funny if he was someone spying on me, thought I was _way_ more influential or representatitve of a social media war than I was, and decided to "rib me" with a book title.

Other than Obama's book being somewhat chastised politely as "not his best effort" and at worst as "the one where he reveals he's still sexually frustrated by being rejected in college and somehow blames it on socialism", I couldn't think of why that title was chosen, given the book's lack of conenctions to the Springsteen song or the biblical reference.

But, I didn't think much of it at the time, similar to my suspicions of DNC sabateouring.

5. *DNC seeks a sexist stereotype and I see right through it, pt. I in an ongiong series of my life*

In retrospect, my direct boss at Vouch Eloise's forced questioning and "oversharing" of her own relationship history as well as an in company sexual harrassment situation that was resolved in several employees leaving was a way for whomeever was telling her what to say to see if I'd react sexistly.

Any behavior easily categorizable as "bait for cheap claims of sexism" was clearly read by me as a tactic to better portray me as a "Bernie Bro" and made me realize the more it occurred in various degrees that the KHive wing of the DNC was likely more in charge than not, and this was due to bitterness over social media wars they wished I took more place in than I did.

6. *DNC seeks a Russian scapegoat to legitimize CIA style investigation on first generation Indian American citizen on US soil*

In order to feel like I _did_ play a role in their social media wars, as well as to amplify the need for drastic, CIA style investigations into a US citizen, the KHive wing of the DNC attempted to paint connections between me and Russia by way of my computer profession being an indicator that I must "be a hacker" despite my strong suspicions that they couldn't really define what that is.

This combination made me potential bait with someone that has authority in both the KHIVe DNC as well as somewhere in the White House itself ti attempt to crucify me simply for the opportunity I posed. If I hadn't been a computer programmer, I probably wouldn't have been targeted as a potential "Russian Hacker" by the DNC McKhartyistHive.

7. *DNC accidentally keeps entrapping the Cryptocurrency industry instead of guiding it or regulating it and bad things happen*

I believe small portions of the Cryptocurrency industry which employed me in 2020 were encouraged to point a finger at me early in 2022 in order to justify connecting me to Razzlekhan, at least for an investigation.

After that made the DNC Khive look bad internally in Washington DC, they continued to entrap larger and larger pockets of the Cryptocurrency industry in attempting to crucify me. This distacted them all to the point that I believe the DNC Khive led the Cryptocurrency industry to the liquidity failures in various Crypto markets as 2022 went on.

8. *DNC / Netflix attempt to make me their Razzle-Dazzle-kahn man leads to lack of political grounding to pass abortion vote despite majority; I donated to Planned Parenthood like monthly for years before going broke to the DNC harrassment Netflix show, but whatever*

More importantly to me, I think this insane series of events led VP Kamala Harris to forgo her responsibilty as the VPOTUS to deal with congress in passing major legislation. It's possible Senator Manchin, as a man, took offense to the attempt to paint me as a sexist via the utility of intelligence services that were beguiled into criminality while investigating due to Netflix, and voted against the Abortion bill.

9. *Let's face it folks: Netflix has been on a backslide since they started making their own content*

This "streaming network" has been putting out a more consistent form of garbo entertainment as we enter into 2020, leveraging reality TV and "true crime" to a larger and larger extent. While the media is popular - titles liek _Tiger King_, _Inventing Anna_ etc - they also create an opportunity where the "star" becomes newly affordable due to their recent imprisonment and legal fees, with _Razzlekhan_ being a recent entry.

I'm not surprised my low rent comedy-over-audio-surveillance routine spelled out "premium value" to these poor taste having ass clowns, but it's worth noting in the early months of 2022, their stock value went from around $600 a share to just below $400 as I started at Vouch, collapsing further to $200 a share when I started working at Liveramp, where I suspect they continued their TV show / investigation alongside the DNC McKhartyistHive infiltrated Biden Harris DOJ and intelligence services and have not yet stopped.

10. *Neera Tanden may have played a role given her ability to control WH messaging at the time as the Staff Secretary to POTUS Biden and may have been motivated due to her long history of Social Media fueds*

Ms. Tanden, a fellow Indian American, may have also played a role in ensuring the POTUS had little to no input or at best late notice of this gross overlap of private business, donor interests, literally military services with regards to the intelligence network, fucking Netflix, and for political purposes that spell out Fascism.

I believe POTUS Biden may have avoided this situation had they known more and I belive Ms. Tanden used her position as the Staff Secretary to influence the flow of information to allow the KHive DNC to conduct an investigation and attempt to frame me for political as well as personal purposes.

Ms. Tanden has a storied history of "Social Media Beef." Politico desribed her in a matter of fact style as "known for her combative Twitter feed and in-your-face politics" [link](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/14/neera-tanden-white-house-488375), and I believe this reputation caused her to see me like many other within the KHive DNC as a target for a political beef I played little role in, but which may have caused Ms. Tanden to be rejected for what is usually a routine nomination to the OMB's office.

I believe she was motivated to take her personal failure out on my future, and played a key role in manipulating my family to act against me as an Indian American -- we both have roots in a country which sold itself out to the British for nearly four centuries; such things as they say takes a village.

(Reader, you may find it interesting that literally 10 minutes after I saved the above point numbered "10" concerning Ms. Tanden to this document to a privately owned location on the internet, I received a rejection from an application I made to join the USDS, or the United States Digital Service, as a web developer. At 2:30 PM, on a Saturday afternoon, June 10th, 2023. A rather uncommon time for anyone in the USDS to work, or any civil service worker for that matter -- maybe Ms. Tanden's influence on the USDS at the beggining of her tenure in the Biden / Harris administration had something to do with it.)

...

I have serious concerns that the DNC KHive along with Netflix and possibly Higher Grounds Productions distracted the Biden / Harris administration in attempting to crucify me in early 2022 to the degree that they lapsed securing the right to abortion despite having a Senate majority. The irony of the Roe v. Wade reversal concerning the lack of a true right to privacy was never lost on me.

...


Reader, I write this in 2023 facing criminal charges brought up in the context of me spending my late 2022 and early 2023 making a series of dropbox videos in the style of a "confessional" outlining these events. I did this largely as a way to clear my name should anyone try and smear it; had the parties I felt were harassing me simply left or provided evidence they were stopping their behaviors, I would have stopped making the videos, and if they can at some point, I could even disavow them. But until then, I'm pretty certain my current situation is not necessarily because of what happened at Vouch, but what's happening to this country: _partisan division over practical politics_. Over social media, no less.

Now, in 2023, I may be facing time or at least a life of always being labeled a criminal simply for trying to make a publicly accessible video recording of not my proof of anything in fact; but what remains a fiction until proven true: my story. All I know is that I was acting, and talking about acting, and acting while talking about acting - but on my own recording devices, not their's.

This has, clearly, and perhaps unfortunately, all been a big joke to me. Haven't you been reading? Not everyone finds me funny, sad but true.

Yes, the charges literally have to do with the video series. And yes, I'm writing this memoir literally as a way to keep my name clear before anything more can happen to me while confined or otherwise.

But that's 2023. Let's get back to early March 2022.
# Pt 1 Ch 9 - Back to my fifth week at Vouch 03/08/2022 and on

> "Why don't you just lie? That's what spies do, you know?" - Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Reader, again, had I known at the time what Razzlekhan meant, I'd of thought of a different plan.

However, as of early March 2022, my perspective was this: I'm under some kind of federal investigation that the boots on the ground are clearly not taking seriously, as well as those conducting the surveillance from behind the scenes. So whoever ordered this isn't necessarily in the immediate picture. I couldn't imagine them being that high "up the chain", and figure'd this was to try and impress someone within the DNC or something given the political framing that could be manipulated were I any kind of criminal, particularly a federal offending one.

Given the Biden Harris administration is one I voted for, I'd rather whomever wanted to impress them for political purposes look bad in front of their bosses instead, while embarassing my bosses or whomever ordered this internally within Vouch, and all while keeping it entertaining for the troops, because, why not, I'm literally naming a human being "buttcheeks" in my head so I can remember them, it's not like I don't have some momentum here. 

I then thought about why they were having so much fun, and I could only assume it was _awkward_ -- the assumptions about me seemed, to me, to be rooted in rascism if anything. I'm just not sure why else the whistle would have been blown on me, at least in this way, and felt that someone acted in a bigoted way and no one wanted to address the obvious political hipocricy so, well, why not act stupid as fuckly?

Again reader, had I realized Razzlekhan was a thing that was to be on Netflix, and what that meant, and where the actual overlaps with mine and their lives were, I would've done _anything_ else.

So anyway, back in early March, I decided to entertain the troops as much as I could, and in turn I decided to act stupid as fuckly as I could.

And reader, had I realized that most of the "troops" were probably acting the way they were out of wanting to be Netflix famous, I probably would've just called a lawyer that minute.

But I didn't know what Razzlekhan was in early March, 2022.

...

I really wish I had been recording myself.

I really should have been at least taking some contemporaneous notes.

That said, I chose not to do these things on purpose at the time because my goal was to get this thing shut down _without_ leaving evidence so whomeever did this stupid ass shit would be handled internally in whater 2 or 3 or 4 letter department let this happen.

I really didn't think this or any White House administration, nor the country in general, needed to embarass itself considering how much effort I took to _not_ do anything illegal or extreme with regards to my "social media leftist" project. I knew that anything they took further would, in the end, embarass them and make them look fascist. I kind of figure'd they'd realize that on their own.

Like I said, I hadn't really thought I could be on a TV show -- that's what I was making fun of my bosses for acting like!

Anyway, when I got home from that walk, after realizing that not only was I followed, I was being surveilled and my movements were being planned against, AND they were for some reason having fun with it and telling each other things like "quick! run ahead of him and flex your ass funny ok, like you were a gay! Gary, I can say a gay, that's ok with you right?" over headset mics and earpieces.

Or so I presumed. It's funny I didn't think _more_ about the possibility of being on a TV show at the time. But I digress.

When I got back home I went to my window so I could look outside across the street and made sure my laptop was nearby as I chastised them.

Again, I can't remember _exactly_ what I said. But I made it clear that I thought the following about a group of people I would come to later, but perhaps then, often describe directly as "you fucks."

1. You fucks aren't one department, you're several, and some are private folks, meaning this isn't anything official
1. Some of you fucks are from around here, and some of you aren't, and some of you fucks are hackers, and some of you are johnny law types
1. Zero of you fucks are taking this seriously

I made fun of how dumb the situation was, mostly, as I recall, and at some point after telling everyone to go home, I got back to work.

I think I said one thing though, just to keep some hope alive in those dumb enough to believe that, given how much change the FBI could say I had in my bank accounts, I was some kind of super hacker.

> "Look, you want to know about me? I used to do some things, with some people, but that's gone now and so are many of them. You happy?"

At least that's the best I can remember. I don't think I really started _lying_ lying until the later that day.

...

I've been playing guitar since about the age of 12.

When I was like, 6, my dad got a cheap acoustic and signed me up for a class where one poor adult soul attempted to, simultaneously, teach about 2 dozen other 6 year olds how to play "twinkle twinkle" on one string using a Mel Bay begginner's guitar book.

I'm pretty sure I went to that class one day, with my father and many other parents looking rather dubious in the back row. We kept the guitar.

One summer day I picked it up and figured out how to play the basic melody to "Louie Louie" on one string as a teenager. It was the opposite string the Mel Bay book started you on, the lowest string. I eventually picked up the Mel Bay book, and after learning "Twinkle Twinkle", I was happy that I wasn't 6 years old, not necessarily because of any reason to do with me - between the years 1992 and 1998, the internet had changed quite dramatically and I could find these coarsely written "tabs" to learn my favorite Blink 182 songs with.

I think I was 35 when I was watching Rick Beato on his YouTube channel interview a storied guitar player I'd learn about shortly after I picked up the guitar in earnest: famed guitar player __ (nts: look I'm 99% sure it's satriani and I missed it a second ago when I rewarched their interview, but it's definitely someone talking to Beato, I think it may be Tim Pierce, but it also could be Satch w/ someone else. I'll do the research before publishing).

The "famed guitar player" regaled Beato with tales of learning the instrument, shared stories of their careers, and finally given they were both industry veterans in 2021, reflections on the industry. In particular, they noted that all you really need is one person who knows how to use a computer, and another person who really wants to be famous, and that's basically the formula these days; they offered in a somewhat ironic but mostly serious tone.

I remember the "famed guitar player" saying something like this in particular:

> "So if you're a character, just go for it."

...

So I felt confident about more than a few things, but mostly two -- my bosses had some sort of audio surveillance software if not also video running on my laptop they gave me, and, I was under some sort of perhaps speculative, off the books, "not" investigation involving both private investigative and federal forces, due to what I assumed at the time were mostly miscommunications between my bosses and the federal government, and at some level a security firm contracted by Vouch, possibly.

Oh, I also felt confident it was something of a joke. I'm not sure if Quantico or Langley offer "buttcheek meanuever training", but I guessed that at the time my situation was the most harmless version of what many call a "black bag operation" on behalf of the intelligence services and law enforcement at a Federal level, with some number of private connections due to my employment.

So I figure'd, well, given that that's my audience -- "intelligence" types and maybe "cops" as well as "politicos," I just couldn't help but think of my favorite TV show of all time, which, you may have guessed, would be USA Networks' _Burn Notice_.

Michael Westen, the show's main character, is your typical absolute absurdist theater of a "spy" whom somehow has the skills of about several dozen people in an incredibly recognizable body that would absolutely have been gunned down by one cartel or some other organization somewhere in the first two seasons of a show, which, despite it's military, intelligence, and at times political allusions, would still be best described as, well, campy.

> CAMP: A sensibility that revels in artifice, stylization, theatricalization, irony, playfulness, and exaggeration rather than content, as Susan Sontag famously defined the term in her short essay, "Notes on 'Camp.'" According to Sontag, "Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized—or at least apolitical"

I knew this was likely inspired at some level by internal Democrat partisanship more than anything, and I just didn't care for that, but I also knew _who_ my audience was - or so I thought.

Look, you ask me what _my_ favorite things about _Burn Notice_ would be? It would be the campy nature of the character's relationships, obviously the narration and it's 'field notes' style writing such to be broader than the context being spoken of, but mostly? The music. Hell yeah, give me that Miami ass soundtrack anytime.

I'm not sure the show couldn't be more apolitical given it's context of the main character being an "on again off again" CIA agent, in Miami of all places, somehow constantly dealing with ex European and often former Soviet agents in the late aughts, but it's not exactly the most political show either.

Again reader, I forgot _everything_ I said, and I'm guessing _someone_ recorded it, but, I think I was just trying to do what Jeffrey Donovan does as Michael Westen: obviously play a character. Often times the Michael Westen character "goes undercover" as spies do, and convinces some criminal cartel -- of which there are an alarming amount of in one city in Florida by the way, and none of them talk about the guy that looks like famed _Wrath of Man_ actor Jeffrey Donovan! -- to do something which typically incriminates them, or makes them run away and stop doing whatever it was they were doing at the episode's beginning.

But the point is, to my opinion at least, Jeffrey Donovan is being obvious as an actor - irl - that his character Michael Westen is acting. He's not being very convincing because he realizes his audience needs to at least have an avenue to understand he's "under cover", and Donovan does my favorite thing on the show.

I lied about the music.

My favorite thing about _Burn Notice_ is Jeffrey Donovan's weird characters that he uses when he goes "under cover" -- there's the crime guy from Bahston, the crime guy from the Redneck Riviera, the crime guy from New Yahk, the mines diamonds but murders the villagers first guy from Australia or maybe somewhere else idk, and many, many more, alongside the equally hilarious caricatures "tactically deployed" by the characters played by Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Coby Bell, Sharon Gless, and many more. They're all great. And yeah, I find them, well, hilarious.

Anyway, the character Michael Westen had numerous skills, but, the show most often relied on his skill of figuring out people and getting them to commit crimes that defame or incriminate them.

So I _think_, as I was really just kind of "riffing", I started playing what to me would be an obviously fake version of a Michael Westen, of some sorts, whom, is just a computer programmer now.

The downfall of camp can be in it's misinterpretation, of course. 

I knew _some_ people would get what I was doing -- maybe not referencing _Burn Notice_ itself, though, perhaps if they had the NSA research my faves for profiling. And I knew some people might... not. Repeating the cycle of the previous experiment where I try to embarass whomever doesn't get that I'm joking.

I don't remember _everything_ I said, but in early March 2022 I remember some shit like this:

> "You all fucked up and now your leadership in various levels both looks bad and is trying to deal with it with as much grace as possible. Let me make something clear: you acted maleovolently here, whether you like it or not, making me the Benevolent Actor. As the Benevolent Actor, chaos will always favor me. I'd reccomend you all find a way out of this situation as soon as possible."

Followed by some other shit like this:

> "Look, sorry Vouch, but you just don't impress me. I've seen it all - an organization like yours isn't any different from your average large criminal organization or even your average small terrorist cell out in the middle east. You don't need to worry about me now - you need to worry about 3 or 6 months from now. You'll start turning on each other and blaming each other. You may not separate or make a legal issue out of it, but your organization will splinter internally in social ways that could be exploited. You'd be better off thinking about your exit strategy here, particularly emotionally, so you all stay together."

Pretty sure 6 months later I'd be setup by the DNC KHive while in the audience of a Bruce Springsteen / Jann Wenner on-stage interview, but reader, I didn't take the bait -- you could say that a champ like me, baby, I was Born to Run, or perhaps, preferred to not gather some wack ass "how do you do fellow kids lets talk about supporting the FTC and call it a culture council" moss - but, I digress. 6 months later I had realized I was on some kind of Reality TV show at least.

Back to March 2022, I just thought my bosses tried playing with the government looked stupid for it - I kept saying shit inferring the above, but making it clear that I was "done" or "out".

I'm pretty sure I wasn't in meetings, I was just talking out loud to a laptop.

I made it pretty clear that if they just wanted to knock on my door and talk things through, I could do that. It was a joke I made several times over the course of the next few weeks. I think they found that one really funny.

During my month or so at Vouch, I was assigned two whole work items; they were both minor. Maybe I'd of had less time on my hands if I was being utilitized as a web developer and not bait for a Netflix television show.

I guess I underestimated my audience, in terms of stature amongst other things.

...

As the evening came, none of the cars across the street showed any indication of moving, and in fact seemed to be going in and out every now and then.

I figure'd it was to pickup food, mostly.

I remember thinking to myself _well ok, this is dumb. There's no way the government would get themselves this involved without first talking to at least some of my relations, especially if any worked in the government... like my sister, for example, who was currently employed by the court system, as well as having a previous stint in the EOC._ And I sighed.

My sister and I have been estranged for around the last 5 years. I've had numerous difficult situations with my family in the past that are probably more than common to first generation immigrant families. Growing up, my sister would often be the one to offer perspectives to my parents to realize that things may be different here -- her being older, this is also very common.

As me and my sister grew older, particularly after she went to college at Brown University, I felt a type of animosity between the two of us. I believe she feels the parents were much harder on her, and that she was held back socially in ways I didn't have to deal with growing up, and as an adult resents me for it.

One time when I was like 19 and back home from college and she was 23 and after her first year of law school I think, the parents were away. I spent the night at a friend's house, and told her I wouldn't be back til tomorrow because we were drinking.

We had put an ounce of weed in a bottle of everclear and let it sit for a week. It seemed better to not drive home. I didn't tell my sister about that, I'm not sure it would have helped.

She warned that the parents wouldn't want that and I of course ignored her. When my parents came home two days later, my sister tried to "rat me out" and see if htey'd yell at me.

They were confused and didn't care. I yelled at her a bit for that, and I regret some of the words I said.

If, some 15 years later, my sister had an opportunity to say to the parents that I was under a Federal Investigation and was actually a criminal this whole time well... she might, it really wouldn't suprise me.

Idk. We've been estranged for well, not shit as stupid as that, but certainly shit like that. I'd prefer her help me out when it comes to my parents a bit more, and I think she'd prefer to... play out some weird sibling melodrama.

Awkward, I know. In retrospect this must have been very easy for certain actors to exploit.

The thought made me somewhat depressed.

...

Later that evening, I decided to go over the scenario a bit more, and somehow came back to the John Wallace message in the DEI chat. Days later he still hadn't edited it.

I wondered -- what if Rajat was being truthful and it was John? Would my theory about him being the guy who hit on Rachel, a 40 year old entry into tech, work out in any other ways?

I remember he recently moved from Wisconsin to Chicago. I looked up the neighborhoods - in WI, he lived in the suburbs. In Chicago, well, it's Chicago. It's a city.

Who moves from the suburbs to a city in their late 40s and is a corporate executive type?

A divorced dork ass loser corporate executive type.

I checked public divorce records in Wisconsin and found information that would match up to Wallace, and indicating that the divorce proceedings must have taken place as he was beginning to talk to Sam Hodges and Travis Hedge about joining Vouch.

I'm guessing he divorced his wife on purpose before joining Vouch to make sure she wouldn't receive his life changing "big tech" money.

Historically, and to this day due to a lack of equal pay laws, it's to some degree true that a woman's best bet in terms of financial security is their marriage.

I think there was something to this mix that really bothered me, considering my sister was a DEI officer and all.

...

_Jesus fucking christ. My sister wants to prove to the parents I'm a criminal and she lied to some feds about me in some stupid ass way and that's a good enough explanation as to why I'm here - her word would mean more than mine given her employment history._

_I want to kill myself._

It was just a thought.

I've had a lot of therapy in my life - a lifetime where I've had to deal with suicidal thoughts.

You really don't want to let them spiral. You need to deal with it in the moment, as you're triggered.

My CBT based technique for such thoughts is structured in 4 steps:

1. Identify what triggered you
1. Summarize it into one thought, emotionally
1. Summarize it into one or two words, emotionally
1. Try and turn it around or see it another way

It may not be what everyone does, but whenever I feel emotionally triggered, I do the above.

CBT comes from a branch of therapy called evolutionary psychology. The idea is that you can "evolve" your brain, or grow emotionally, given repetitive exercises.

I've been doing the above 4 step process for over a decade now.

It really helps, so I did it for this case.

1. Identify what triggered you

_I'm pretty sure my sister, my employer, and my government have put me under some dipshitted investigation that no one outside of some opportunists are taking seriously, and that given those constraints, I'll probably never hear the truth about at best or at worst will be thrown into a hole for the rest of my life and everyone's gonna get away with this like it was nothing._

2. Summarize it into one thought, emotionally

_I'm getting fucked over by my family, my employer, and my country. My family has difficulties with me and at least I owe back taxes; not sure what Vouch's deal is._

Sometimes I'm flexible with the rules; that was two thoughts.

3. Summarize it into one or two words, emotionally

_Fear and anger_

4. Try and turn it around or see it another way

_Well, I am handling this like a fucking legend. I'm gonna be a weird story for sure to a bunch of random spooks no matter what happens. It's not the worst thing for a fan of_ Burn Notice. _Not something I'll ever get to share but every now and then someone's gonna give me a funny look and I'll just assume that they were involved in this and move on, smiling back if I can._

At this point, thinking of how Michael Westen's fictitious family consistently does NOT rat him out to the government despite several opporutnities to do so, I was triggered yet again and had to repeat the above cycle.

I didn't feel that bad. I wasn't that afraid, certainly not after turning things around. That said... me having a history of therapy, and a succesful one, is rare in the population in general.

_They might do this stupid ass shit again. Someone's gonna kill themselves if many haven't already like this. How can I make this worse so these people don't do this again?_

I thought about a lot of the characters in _Burn Notice_, and perhaps I thought of Lucy Lawless' assassin in Season 1, who kills herself to avoid Michael from taking her to the authorities.

It's probably a pretty common ending for a lot of "super duper secret covert" folks.

Also, I wanted to find out, just exactly what kind of moral behavior could I expect from these people?

Could I get them to _not_ react, and show some sense of shame?

I thought and came up with something like this, saying it aloud to my laptop at some point after midnight.

> "Sigh. Well, you're all obviously connected to money and DC. I don't really know who you are, but looking at things, if Wallace was the guy that fingered me through a mob connection and that's how this started... well, look, I'm gonna take a walk and if you have to take me out, then, you know, do what you have to do. Otherwise, I think I'm gonna buy some cream cheese. But do what you need to do."

I think I acted wistfully about the day or some shit, and tried to give the impression of a person accepting their death or imprisonment under the kind of terms that often comes with representing but being outside of the law, say, on movies and TV shows like _Burn Notice._

...

I can't remember the exact time. I really should have been taking notes. But I'm pretty certain it was after midnight.

Vouch was largely a west coast company and meetings were all well after 12 PM ET, for whatever that's worth.

I headed out onto Clinton St, eventually turning right on Broome St. It's not just a quiet street but a few blocks up is an NYPD precint. This was, I thought, a polite way to acknowledge their likely involvemnt, as well as, well, if things really were _that_ dirty in this world, take care of me right there.

Or, fuck up while doing so in a way that gets you caught near a NYPD precint. Either or.

Reader, did I really think I was going to be killed?

Well, therapists often ask, if they are aware you're feeling or capable of feeling suicidal, to rate your emotional state at the moment from a 0 to a 10, with the 10 being as suicidal as you could possibly feel wiht 1 being the least.

I'd say I was at a 1.5 at that moment, but mostly due to the decade or so of therapy helping me through, well, other situations.

Convienently at the time I remember thinking _I don't know. Maybe 15% chance I get detained and questioned in some weird shady way, and like 1.5% it leads to me being detained long term in a weirder shady way, with about .15% for getting like shot or stabbed in the streets or something._

None of that happened of course, but what gambler wouldn't feel confident about 85% odds in your favor? This wasn't the 2008 Super Bowl, and if it was, I don't think I'd be on New England's side, I say sitting in Manhattan writing this to you, dear reader.

Look it up.

Anyway, I walked by the precint on Broome and saw a single officer sitting outside in one of those smaller 3 wheel vehicles. His body was tight and read nervous to me, facing forward, with his eyes clearly in the side of his sockets, trying to look at me, without looking directly at me.

I could be wrong about their eyes; it was about 25 feet away and they were in a car. But I wasn't wrong about them feeling nervous.

Reader; it's not that kind of neighborhood, not even after midnight. Not for an NYPD officer, anyway.

I turn a right and get back onto Grand st, walking back towards my apartment. While walking down I did detect someone behind and across the 4 lane (nts: check notes) street from me walking in my direction, and made out their basic form.

The best I could tell you was that they were a "young black male", aged "16-40", about "5 foot 3 to 5 foot 8," but, that's very normal for the area, no matter what the hour.

At a darkish area, with no stores and an unlit yard to my side, I suddenly heard a light scuffle behind me.

Reader, I remember my thoughts -- I wasn't really afraid in that moment of anything _human_.

I turned, and I'll admit, I had my arms on the way up a bit, with my hands out. I didn't intend violence, just, maybe more of an instinct to protect myself.

The training, did not, "kick in." Though I don't have the video to know how it may have appeared.

Near immediately I saw the man I thought I identified across the street -- they somehow very quietly got close and then about 3 feet away, purposefully scuffled their feet so I could hear. The latter is a move I often do myself to elt people know I'm behind them, though usually from a greater distance.

But I also make sure I don't quietly sneak up on anyone in the darkness because well - I'm a really dark skinned individual myself, even for an Indian guy.

When I say those were my immediate thoughts, in the moment, they were, because they're my most "go to" reactions in this scenario which happens often to dark skinned people in places everywhere where not everyone feels safe around you.

This man was about 3 feet away from me and unlike the NYPD officer earlier, I was certain of their reaction to me.

The black man behind me had a face that read of guilt, and a bit of shame; particularly in their eyes.

A recurring program that's been running quite often in reaction to odd events in my life starts writing itself in my head:

```
function handle_weird_incident_in_public_while_being_investigated
  if you_have_reasonable_doubts_that_this_is_plausible then
    react_with_immediacy_in_a_plausible_manner
    consider_things_contextually_later
  else if you_are_sure_this_is_related_to_some_clownshow_if_not_yours then
    act_like_a_clown_the_worst_is_youll_ruin_a_private_joke_and_be_seen_as_weird_to_strangers
  end
end
```

This was a situation I handled given how plausible it was to me and recurring. Every now and then, maybe while wearing headphones, I've turned around and saw someone I didn't realize was behind me, and they were dark skinned. The immediate reaction I have on my face may be shock, which may read as racist sure, but my hurt someone else's feelings in a way I've been hurt.

That'd make me feel bad in my case, so, generally speaking but in any and all cases where I turn around and am "surprised" by a random dark skinned stranger, I usually say what I said to the guy behind me:

> "Oh, I'm sorry."

And I turned around before they could get past me, to indicate I didn't fear them or whatever, they just startled me.

The man then walked past me with a quickened pace. He started takling out loud like he was mentally ill, and waving his hands back and forth similar to an NFL referee's "no good" signal when a field goal is missed. I couldn't make out everything he was saying, but at some point, as he walked ahead of me and waved his hands back and forth, I heard him say quite a few times:

> "Not in New York! Not gonna happen in New York! Not in New York!"

Ah, I thought: _So I saw not one but two NYPD officers tonight, and that look of guilt or shame had more to do with their vocation than just your basic racial politics. Awkward._

As I walked back down Clinton st towards my apartment -- I couldn't get cream cheese as the store I wanted was closed and really I didn't need anymore dairy -- a procession of cars that I recognized as being parked under the FDR slowly moved pass me. I took it as a sign of respect.

In retrospect -- I should have left things there.

But that's given hindsight. I didn't know about Razzlekhan or even think that the upper most levels of government I live in could be working with Netflix literally, and possibly tying in a recent show with whatever this was.

All I remember thinking was I was pissed off that Vouch put me through this and they'd better have something to say for it.

But it was late, and it was after midnight, and I'm pretty sure I went to sleep after going home. I can't remember what if anything I said to my captors afterwards.

At least the NYPD didn't want to kill me.

...

The next morning I decided to stay in bed for awhile. I was awoken late, sometime after 10 AM, to a door knock.

I opened the door to a black man, a bit shorter, younger and ever so slightly lighter skinned than I, who was different than the man in the street from last night. He was wearing a backpack.

I was in my boxers and a tshirt and I was probably looking at him not terribly friendly like, given my condition and the previous night's events. He gave me an awkward glance before breaking the silence.

Or maybe the awkward glance was from seeing my bong out in plain sight behind me.

Either way, after a few moments, he said something like:

> "Oh, uhm, we must've gotten the wrong apartment."

I could be wrong but I am pretty sure he said "we".

I closed the door and I presume they left. I went back to sleep a bit before meetings that day.

I felt at the time in March he could be a "hacker" type, such to explain their look and appearance.

I'd see him a few months later talking to someone else I thought was following me. They made little effort to be hidden and were easy to "make" in Essex market.

I'm now pretty sure that guy worked or works for Netflix or a subsidiary, and I'm certain I could make him in any number of photographs of team parties etc.

Nice guy, though.

At the time, in March 2022, my biggest take away was this:

_OK, so this is probably a sign from the government saying they're out because this is awful. That means it's just my bosses and whatever private security firm they're working with._

Again, "Had I known about Razzlekhan and Netflix etc etc etc." I'm sure you can fill in the sentence there.

...

I woke up and didn't feel great about the situation. I wanted to find some way to communicate to the company that I was aware in a way that could page for reactions.

Over the previous weeks, I had started playing Cake's _Shadow Stabbing_, as kind of a cute way to reference detectives, with the lines in the chorus: "The man over there might just as well be" -- I wasn't ever direct, but I covered it more and more over that time as a wink to anyone who would be up for "getting it" while audio surveilling me.

I'm also a big Elvis Costello guy. His first album in particular. In the modern cut it has an extra song called _Watching the Detectives._

It's a favorite of mine. It can be interpreted many ways, but, to me, it's not really about spies and detectives persay, but it's about a woman who's bored with her lover and is instead "watching the detectives" on TV, which is to say, well, something like my situation.

It's also literally called _Watching the Detectives_.

I decided to, somewhat out of the blue, share it on a group chat at work as an offering.

I got little emoji reaction, but in the one meeting I attended, I couldn't help but get a feeling out of someone on my team that felt extra... jovial. As though they knew something funny that I didn't, but in a way that felt... special to me.

It was just an instinct. I'd often just chalk such things up to paranoia.

CBT helps with those feelings.

But CBT wasn't really designed to help with the context of possibly being in a federal investigation spurred on by not only your employer's surveillance tech vs technique issues, but the fantasies other people have developed as realities via social media politics that I, dear reader, as of March 2022, had abstained from for almost half a year.

It's been nearly a year and a half since I've tried to have any affects on politics via social media, by not using the stuff for politics, if anything.

At the time of writing my goal of getting off social media has remained achieved, though, not without it's apparent costs to politics.

In 2023, my relevance often leaves me at a loss against the poetic nature of it's arrival. But in 2022, I was mostly hoping this would all go away quietly.

Maybe I missed posting. And how people react.

But I couldn't help but wonder:

_I've seen this person talk several times and in many forms of excitement. They now seem like they have something funny to hide. Could it be about the song I shared? And how could they find this... funny?_

_Is this company gossipping about me behind my virtual back while I have to deal with cops being forced to do a phony investigation on me to make my bosses feel tough?_

I asked Eloise, my boss, for the rest of the week off. She said yes without hesitation.
# Pt I Chapter 10 - A brief explanation on why I'm such, at least at this point of my life, a loser

*explain to your dear reader why you weren't really uhhh socializing at all in any normative ways and how that may have looked given the context*

*tell them you're a loser and you knew it but it was fine since you are in between definitive states in your adult life and you're not as hung up about it as others may perceive which, normally, isn't my problem*

*imply that in the context of people spying on you you didn't care because you're in your mid thirties and don't really care what people who would spend that much money and time ot spy on you would think in the first place*

*finish with why you didn't care because you realized how, historically, people like you are treated after trying things like the video game project, and that, in feudal times, you'd be beheaded, and in modern times, you figure'd a federal investigation to clear your (my) name early on in my life before I get a business going may actually be the best thing for me*

...

*get back to the weekend and reflect on the meeting where the guy with the dog seemed, well, excited about the whole thing, and talk about how you were concerned Vouch was treating this interanlly as a matter of gossip. Reflect on the Sandanista-baiter and how they both likely dyed their hair recently AND seemed very, well, excited, and talk about how at the time you read it as gossip. "reader, had I known about Razzlekhan or gave a fuck about reality tv or true crime etc etc"*

*to re-introduce Vouch, given that the next chapter is quitting the company, make a brief reflection on the work you were assigned while there -- two tasks, one seeming suspicious as though they wanted to know something about image bullshit -- but underline that over a month period you received little to no direction or direct work orders, pointing to at best internal disorganization and at worst internal disorganization due to a Netflix show*

I never got a direct confrontation from my bosses, but I realized that if I brought it up and they reacted more strongly than the situation warranted, it was probably the best answer I'd get as to whether or not they fooled their way into incriminating the federal government.

Also, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

# Chapter 13 - Second Week post Vouch, 3/27/22

> [Michael narrating while being beaten by Fiona] It's unfortunate but true that no makeup can simulate blood and bruises well enough to stand up to close observation. So if your cover requires looking like you've been beaten... you have to get beaten.

I never thought I'd had to consider something like this, but by the end of the last week of March in 2022, I was having this thought:

_Would the government perceive my suicidality as an attempt to cover something up?_

I didn't think much of it, given my next thought:

_Even if they did, they'd likely switch back to an investigation that doesn't involve my employers and just watches me using normative creep tactics like... watching and not reacting. I'm not doing crimes so that's fine by me, if a little weird, but I can accept that if the value is that these people don't do thsi stupid shit again._

Furthermore:

_It's not like I'm going stop therapy on my own accord anytime soon, so let's just all watch me discuss my family issues, I can't imagine they'd go further than that - just watching me not commit crimes and repair my psyche. That's not illegal. I am going to have to lie to my therapist a bit though, that kind of sucks._

Reader, had I known the spectre of Netflix fame was motivating the government, and not just a hopeful political smear to move someone up the chain of command of whatever they belonged to, I might've asked myself a third question:

_What if a normal investigation where it's just the government and not the government, my employers, and my family weren't enough in terms of the motivations of whomever wanted this?_

But even as I imagined the literal VP Kamala Harris wanting to crucify me for a political opportunity, I still couldn't imagine how taking a risk on a second investigation with a second employer would be worth it.

At the time it was also way too outlandish to take seriously. She's the Vice President of the United States. I'm a 36 year old loser who lives alone and is in 6 figure debt due to entrepreunerial ambitions and/or "failures."

I'd doubt she really would need to prove something about me that the above sentence wouldn't suffice.

Reader, I don't watch much reality TV, and I don't think I'd ever throw my career away to get on one of those or any TV show. I am, however, probably throwing my career away to get one of those shows cancelled, for the better of my country's history and reputation, if not just myself.

But that's me in 2023. Let's get back to 2022.

# Chapter 14

> "Michael Westen: [holding Chechik at knifepoint] You should stick to hunting things that don't fight back."

I probably should _not_ be a role model for anything.

I definitely should _not_ be a role model for therapy's benefits, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Except for maybe to some like, classified CIA documents or some weird shit like that.

Reader, you may be looking back on my exercise, the one I do when I get "triggered", and asking yourself this:

`Ok. So the idea of being under a covert investigation, including the possibility of being framed such to legitimize said investigation, was triggering to you. That's understandable. Did this CBT therapy thing make you try to... turn it around, such that you acted that way? And without it, would you have just acted out of normal fear and anger, in a way that would have been easier to handle?`

Look man, I've been through a lot in my life that hasn't involved the CIA or CBT. I don't think my reactions were purely the result of the therapy I've become well, reflexive in utilizing when I feel triggered emotionally.

Normally I'm "turning around" things like... ok it's been awhile, to be honest. The stuff works.

But like a decade ago in my 20s, I had trouble with thoughts like "I'm not successful enough" and "my parents will never love me" and "everyone secretly hates me and is waiting for an opportunity to align with political, financial, and media forces to smear me before I can achieve my destiny".

When you turn around thoughts liek that, you end up with counters like "I'm actually very successful, let me count the ways," "my parents can get bent but they do love me in their own way particularly with how they raised me financially speaking", and "wow that's crazy shut up, are you hungry or something?"

It did take almost 5 or so years to get used to using that "system" to counter thoughts, and after around a decade, I'm not sure if I have the first thought - the trigger - without near automatically having the next, though, I may not have to count the ways I could be considered succesful as much.

But in this situation? Could I have made a better decision, with respect to the fact that I had no idea about Razzlekhan or felt that it was possible I was on a Netflix show?

...

It's probably not from CBT, but another thing I picked up in therapy that works very nicely alongside being a programmer is basic "worst case scenario" planning.

In a situation that peaks your anxiety or triggers you or whatever, asking yourself some variety of "what the worst case scenario" or "what's the worst that could actually happen" is a great way to bring reality to measure against your emotions.

_I haven't heard from my tailor about the thing and I got the other thing I need the first thing for coming up tomorrow._

What's the worst that can happen?

_I'll have to use my backup thing to take care of the formerly mentioned thing such that I'll be good for the laterly mentioned thing._

Different things peak different people for different reasons. This fictitious person above has obviously had childhood trauma concerning button repairs on a family heirloom, and now refers to all dry cleaning arrangements as a mobster for some reason. That said, the dry cleaners triggers them, and they need to calm down, and this exercise helps them to get realistic.

In programming, it's usually a great way to ask yourself, well "if" this thing is true, what "else" may be true in opposition, and to an extreme bounds?

Anyway, I don't think that's CBT, it's pretty basic, and it's helpful in a lot of ways.

...

In April, I'd learn about something I've heard about from my then therapist: DBT.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, separate though influenced by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, seems to have another system of dealing with complicated or "triggering" thoughts, albeit not one that counters CBT though in my dillettante's opinion, adds to it.

That said, the KHive DNC infiltrated my therapist through these events and I'm likely going to stay away from therapy until this situation can meet some resolution. I'm grateful I got to it well before as a result, and would encourage those not in my situation to seek therapy just as a way to explore yourself.

You don't need to be broken to be better.

But I digress. DBT, to me, as I was learning a bit about it in April, oddly seemed to somewhat represent the dialogue system in a video game I started playing that month as well: _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. Probably a coincidence, maybe not.

At any rate, DBT encourages you to see your brain as having two major "reflexive" response types to situations. I'm not certain on the correct terminology, but I remember it as "emotional" responses and "logical" responses.

DBT encourages you to ask what those persepectives are, then seek a third persepctive that incorporates both of those and helps decide the "best" decision: the wise mind.

Reader, the wise mind has nothing to do with the stereotypes you may or may have not heard about "wise guys", but that may not affect you as much as it does me.

I've often thought about this situation, and had I parsed it through DBT, how would I have reacted.

Given that I didn't think a private corporation like Netflix was involved, and it was most likely a government which has made a recent post 9/11 history of detaining at best and possibly torturing at worst brown civilians based on suspicions made of their race and their race alone?

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.

Emotionally, at the time: _I feel that my basic human rights were being violated by people who wanted to believe a fantasy over anything that could be proven as fact, in a way that insinuated it was personal, but with utilities that are explicitly usable against any human being, and I also feel kind of pissed off that I think they're doing it to "play" with technology they don't know about as much as I do, professionally speaking. But more directly: These motherfuckers do_ NOT _know me
and they really feel like they have to prove to someone that they do, and that makes me fucking angry._

Logicaly, I thought: _I need to worry about these people falsely incriminating me in order to validate their assumptions. There is either a financial motive in proving whatever they assumed about me, or there is a personal motive. Either way, I need to get ahead of them eventually falsely incriminating me as they've spent way too much money already and given the tech industry's involvement liekly are seeking some kind of return on their investment._

Like I said, I never did the DBT thing that much, due to the events outlined here, but that was how I was seeing it.

I kept coming to this conclusion that month when trying it and still do when trying to be "wise": _I'm pretty sure if I keep breadcrumbs of embrassment and nothing more, alongside not being a criminal in truth, I'm doing the wise mind thing. Just like, a human rights version. I really hope this story just goes away eventually as it likely was just a mistake due to financial mis motivations and hopefully not by someone too high up the Federal food chain, I really don't need credit, and as long as I keep not wanting fame out of this as my true intent, I should be fine. People in this country would not see me a Woodward or Bernstein but more of some weird citizen version of Elian Gonzales probably, batshit people around here, I don't need that fame. But the worse they act, the more I have to escalate to draw attention to wider circles such to incur accountability and prevent them from falsely incrminating me._

And in the furthest reaches of my mind I thought: _Well, Kamala Harris is half Indian, surely if this was that crazy she'd never let this go so far..._

But then I remembered, even in the furthest reaches of my mind, VP Harris' history in California of famously locking up 3rd offenders aggressively alongside seeking convictions against marijuana offenders to the point of earning a reputation.

Then I remembered, in the furthest reaches of my mind, that India has twice the population of the European continent yet was under various European colonist rule for four centuries.

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.
# Pt 1.5 -- A flash to the future

### Mid afternoon near the end of the workday in a conference call with around 8 people on Friday, May 20 2022

This was the first time in this situation where I was so shocked I developed tunnel vision.

_I... are.. they... grimacing?_

Friday afternoons offer most workplace teams the chance to blow off a little steam with some polite conversation about, say, the weekend, or the less than pro forma parts of the job, like differences in laptop CPUs and more (I'm a programmer working in tech with other programmers, talking about CPUs for fun isn't weird ok).

_Are... they... responding... to what I said...?_

It was my second week in the job, and, things seemed suspicious yet again even before I started this job.

_Did... they... remove their hair tie on purpose...?_

Given my suspicions started before the new job did, and this was after the Vouch fiasco, if you read the previous part you'd be safe to assume I was running `the_gg_move` as often as I could muster, which meant most any meeting with 5+ people where I could politely turn my camera and mic off without fear of feeling socially awkward.

Maybe it's the lack of that fear that causes me to act, but, in previous cases, if no one responds, I get to stop acting, and I know that the "mute" button means just that - if it's honest, I can be too.

_Are... they... wait... did someone tell them to do that...?_

That said, `the_gg_move` is an act, a lie, so, sometimes I say things that are lies to purposefully cajole people. Not always though.

At one point in this afternoon meeting, with around 8 or so people in it, the entire small team I was working with if I recall, someone brought up their laptop being old. I started talking to myself in response, with my mic on mute and camera off:

> "Well, I gotta say this laptop they gave me is really nice, spec wise. Gonna be a shame when I return it after quitting."

My coworker seemed to flinch, in concern. At that point something clicked -

_So they were given audio surveillance on me, they're younger than me, they're supposed to be my coworker, they're not even my boss, they share the same title as me, and they get to audio surveil me. And for some reason, they would be concerned if I were to quit._

I realized that technically, I was an asset - I'm a very good programmer, and a good team mate to boot. I'm good at what I'm hired to do, when I'm given a chance to do it.

But maybe more importantly -

_People only get concerned if there's something to lose. I'm not the only asset. Someone is selling this audio surveillance software to big tech companies, and likely at a unit level. Otherwise my coworker and HR people at Vouch wouldn't be introduced to what is essentially spycraft. I'm in a sales pitch._

Or, at least I thought at the time.

My coworker was a woman with blonde hair. I do know that many with blonde hair identify as not having hair that is a certain color, but being of an identity known as "blonde." What I said next was to try and trigger, and yes, maybe "cyber bully" the person who flinched in response to something they could only have heard via audio surveillance, as the rest of the team was joking.

If I was wrong, she certainly wouldn't have reacted further.

> "Ah... I see I don't have to worry about HR, what I have to worry about is hair dye."

Reader, I'm 75% certain I said "hair dye" and not "blonde hair dye", as I'm ok with all colors in the skittles rainbow, not just yellow. But she was blonde and I may have said just that.

_Is... she... she's... flipping her hair at me while grimacing?_

My coworker seemed to double down by removing her hair tie, fixing her face in disgust, staring right at the camera and flipping her hair somewhat violently forward with her hands in a gesture that I had to feel was more of a communication than a styling attempt given she had to fix her hair afterwards, and seemed _angry_ about it.

I mean, maybe I'm wrong. I just remember not looking at anyone else, even though she was in a small window given that seh wasn't the current speaker and thinking:

_Did she do that on her own? Or did someone tell her to do that?_

Look, `the_gg_move` is not exactly a way to make friends.

It's a way to figure out to what extent you're being audio surveilled by your boss.

And, apparently, your younger co workers of the opposite gender.
# Part 2: Post Vouch, Pre LR -- Mid March to the start of May 2022 

### Goals

1. You need to bring up making a "tiktok" just to try and give people you assumed were just federal investigators the feeling like all you wanted was to be a social media musician so they would fuck off and just let me play guitar covers and not act liek idiots at Liveramp. Instead, I think this really made everyone act super idiotically at Liveramp, considering the Razzlekhan thing. Some must've thought it "fit the content," others may have thought I was trying to "send a message", and well it'd be SO funny to bring up the fact that I'm pretty sure I covered 99 red ballons (nts: check tiktok stop being embarssed about it) -- I literally stopped because of hwo stupid Liveramp's investigation got
1. Talk about being depressed in the past, using therapy to not be as fucked up about it, but kind of lying about it to see if the government or whomever would try and use that against me (they did, they keep trying to, it's horrifying in it's implications)
1. Talk about patching yourself up over the next few weeks, being vocal -- just in case anyone was listening -- about a lot of my problems as a way to also just self talk my way through my problems. If whomever was listening got "pissed off" at my insinuation that many of my issues are from how I was raised, in weird subtle ways, then that was a heavy indicator that if things continued then somehow someone else's career now may hinge on the fact that they believe my mother's perspective of my own childhood more than mine, which, I can understand for my family arguments, but even my own mother never risked her career or livelihood over validating her or my perspective, we just have sore feelings over it. Whcih is to say, I didn't care if anyone listened to my self talk, I was actually legit very depressed, but paging further reactions to it for sure, beign aware that I knew I was talking out loud about my personal problems, as well as with my therapist
1. Dedicate some time to how you did indeed get to a better point by mid April, and made a plan to manage my debt + expenses against Liveramp's upcoming employment should it hold. I recognized needing an outside office as a way to just walk around, enjoy the neighborhood, and budgeted for that item at The Yard on Delancey, as a way to combat my depression. Despite the financial costs - 700 a month - I did this for my mental health but also in hoping anyone watching my behavior would see "wow, he's doing personal budgeting to help resolve the financial gap we caused due to the previous investigation, while reassessing what he wants in life to be more comfortable and spend more outdoor times and time around other human beings while working, maybe we should leave him alone." Alas
1. Might wanna dedicate a whole chapter to your own depression, collision with suicidal thoughts, how you've learned to deal with them, how you've accepted other people handle them when made aware, and how you used all of this to feel out the situation: did the government and private actors that positioned themselves against me at Vouch not care about my mental health, and in fact, seek to take advantage of it should I make it seem more unstable on purpose than not? I'll admit this was dishonest to my therapist, but, it was a special situation


### Outline

1. Start by going over history of therapy, describe CBT process as the way I handle "triggering" thoughts and have for over a decade. Describe the idea of evolutionary psychology and say you're a believer; but it took a lot more work than just taking pills, I had to make the change, not my therapists or some doctor. Emphasize the work and that other options are essentailly shortcuts, to you. That said, beacuse you can handle when others try and trigger you, this process involved a changing of my own personal character such to "counter trigger" those trying to trigger me with, say, shit about the Sandanistas, for an example.
1. Go over early April, suicidality, wanting to talk to family with therapist, your family and especailly your sister's shadyiness there, ultimately your therapist suggests it may be a bad idea.
1. Go over mid April, pathicng yourself up, and going over self talk. Internally I made a promise: I need to permanently keep my parents and family out of my life as much as possible; I did this more or less already and th enew "thing" would be avoiding jobs with overlaps, like iwth Sam Hodges and Amrita Mallik. My fault, I guess. I'm sure my famliy feels that way. End chapter with personal declaration of vengeance should this shit continue.
1. Go over pre LR - weird packages, weird HR, peeing in a cup, therapist feels alarmed at me brining things up in a non therapist way, start to feel certain my therapist is talking to feds in the BG
1. Probably best to end on finally getting the LR laptop on the morning of your first day after all the shipping awkwardness
1. End with the above and a thought you had: _Why would they keep this up and not just put me under some long term surveillance thing where I can at least act like I'm not aware of them?_ -- now I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Netflix and Razzlekhan more than any internal implications, but, anyway, end the section and final chapter with that thought before getting to LR.
# Pt 2.5 - A flash to the future

### Somewhere near the end of July, in my bathroom, with the door open, with my ipad out, reading random things about computers or guitars until I worked up the swerve to masturabte to internet porn

_Jesus christ that thing is big. Where did it come from?_

So seeing the man I nicknamed "Tevas" again the other day was certainly something, even if he traded his namesakes for what looked like combat boots with splattered paint on them. I realized after that that I couldn't sell the laptop Liveramp gave me after quitting, out of fear of some immature prank being pulled with it.

_Why did it lift it's leg liek that on the way in? Is that thing... drunk?_

I decided that if I kept the laptop, I had to make up some response to the stunt near the park on Essex st. the other day, so I used it to make up a website called "bigbosswatch.com", to make fun of these people for being immature with audio surveillance in the workplace.

_I could kill it. It's probably going to go down the drain in my sink. I'm gonna not masturbate with my ipad now, that's for sure._

So I kind of knew I should expect _some_ kind of response, though I wasn't sure how tied into my building of 275 South St. my government street stalkers turned prank show wannabes were yet.

_But then I wouldn't be able to learn more about it._

I had a feeling it was a television prank show, and when I was sitting on my toilet reading stuff about computers or something on my iPad, thinking about masturbating, I saw a large roach about 2-4 inches crawl into my bathroom, I figure'd that at this point, the prank show people had taken over a few units and were tied into my building's maintenance crew - it's really hard to imagine anything else.

_It's definitely not from this area. I've lived here ten years, I'd of seen one like it by now. What I have probably won't kill it... but it may keep it around._

It was late July and near 90 degrees, plus the building has gardens outside which attract bugs of this kind if anything. A roach this size wouldn't want to be indoors, and 8 floors up in this weather. And it was of a type I just hadn't seen ever in this building - usually if cockroaches come inside, they're small. It's why I have small cockroach bait in my apartment, which, by the way, wasn't _that_ dirty at the time, in terms of things cockroaches like, which is food. Though the floors could have used a cleaning, that's for sure. Did I mention I'd live'd there for ten years?

_Wait... did that thing... just... look at me?_

When I saw it, I hiked up my pants, and got out of the bathroom. I got used to leaving the doors open - I knew I was being surveilled, though I hadn't figure'd it for a prank show. I got in the habit of keeping my door open while using the bathroom - for everything, yes, including masturbation - just so if anyone had to surveil me -- you know, for their job -- they'd have to make the choice between being pervs or being ashamed.

_Well... at least it seems to want the food..._

I went to my kitchen where I got the small cockroach bait. On the one hand it may kill the roach, on the other hand, it could just survive and feed off the stuff. When I got back I tossed the trap at the cockroach, who, well, I know this sounds weird -- but it just seemed to be _aware_ of my presence and _care_ about the fact that it shared the space with me... almost like it was familiar with humans?

~~I immediately put two and two together and realized the CIA must have micro motor technology, which can simulate the movement of cockroaches but are actually surveillance devices of a kind only the ingenious nature of the American military can construct~~

Here's what I was thinking, looking at the roach:

_Ok. So these guys probably put a roach in my apartment that was as big as they could find. My feeling based on how it's moving and the fact that it came straight to my bathroom is that they gave it a little whiskey or something to make it dehydrated and want to seek water, like in the toilet or maybe the sink, so I'd see it while on the toilet, something they know I do while I read my ipad or masturbate as I've ensured they could see, even without bathroom cameras, which I'd hope they're not using._

My heart raced a bit reader, I'll admit. Earlier in June I contacted former JAG Jesse Sommer, also a former colleague of mine who over a decade ago told me he was getting a JD MBA and joining the military specifically to serve as a JAG for a decade and go as far within the Democratic party electoral system as possible. At the time I thought well of that, because I thought well of him.

At this time, looking at this roach, who seemed to be looking at me, I realized two things.

_This roach definitely knows that I'm human. It was probably raised by someone who rents out roaches to Netflix shows or whatever, like an insect farmer or something._

and

_My former colleague Jesse Sommer is likely engaged me with this Netflix thing and if he asked people from the military to prank me into "respecting the federal government," well that would be fascism and I need to try and make a plan where Jesse can save face. That said, what if he wasn't lying about being a "special ops JAG" or wahtever that may be... guys from that section of the military could come from any branch and could be well, incredibly equipped to prank people. Also_ Burn Notice _as well as what I've read of former Navy SEAL team 6 and Red Cell leader Richard Marcinko aka "the Geek" makes it somewhat clear that Navy SEALs can be gross and flex about it. These people might take this really far. God damnit. I should have been an electrician, I should have never learned to make websites. Then I wouldn't never met Jesse Sommer. Here's to hoping they don't do me like they did Marcinko; I never served, it'd be kind of weird._

I started panicking and figure'd it'd be best to, if yet again, see if anyone would follow me in the streets. I'd deal with my new roommate in a few days.

I remember having one last thought as I left my bathroom to take a walk outside:

_These fuckers better not throw me in the East River either. Sure I act like a Cosmo Kramer from_ Seinfeld _, sure, but I'm not trying to take things that far._
# Part 3: The Liveramp Fiasco -- the start of May to early June 2022 

### Goals

1. I mean, lol, just try not to sound like you're bragging. Or that you had as much fun as you did. That shit was hilarious though.
1. I think it might be good to have a flashback to twitch streaming from late 2017-early 2021 ish as an explanation of a) how you familiarized yourself with "reading faces" while on computer webcams before the general population could w/ covid, and you were familiar with tells such as "are they reading from a chat log like literally every twitch channel" etc. Also, this would explain how you may be... used to... acting as a "psuedo character" while on live audio / video feeds, though, that character was a "video game developer" and is a lot closer to "literally really you." Maybe, leave the identity crisis parts out.
1. This was why I may have seemed like I had "training" that put me ahead of... middle managers in tech mostly, who have no "intelligence" training, and then intelligence workers who may not be as aware of technological shifts due to being "in the field" and realize that the things I knew most of the "younger generation" that populated twitch (the development channels skew older, but, it's still younger) would know to a certain percentage. This type of surveillance "technique" -- audio surveillance converted to chat logs for your manager to be able to read in real time or at a later time what you were saying to your laptop -- would be the type of things children in America already knew how to, well, counter, intelligence wise. I just knew it because I thought streaming myself learning game development as a professional web programmer would be interesting (it was, sort of, but also a drag, streaming is a lot of effort).
1. Use the above as an... onramp?... to what happened the week of 05-22-2022, against being pissed off that these people were selling some bullshit ass software that was obviously NOT working out, why you, felt confident doing what you did. Also, audio surveillance not made like, clear, is not terribly admissable in court, and if they just.. asked me about what I was saying while on "mute"... well, I was literally, actually, working on a character, I was acting. Woops. Do you want to give me something to do at work so you can judge me on that? Because... I didn't ge tmuch of that here either.
1. Definitely a decision to be made here with regards to how much I reference _Burn Notice_ because it's almost too easy
1. Need to decide how much of "pre liveramp" needs to be discussed. Not sure anything outside of a quick chapter may be necessary, perhaps two.
1. Big decision on how much of the markdown essays should be here. They're great but... long... and... confusing, though I wrote them that way on purpose a bit.
1. Open a chapter / section with the pontification I've had that the second ammendment is misread wrt firearms -- the real question is when the government has tipped over into tyranny, should the citzenry have anything to do with it? Or just watch facsism rise and allow a new normal to be justified by a court system that is suffocated by a non working legislative system led by an executive system that seeks celebrity and fame given the success it perhaps cheated to win with doesn't satisfy it's ego? Again, if the government is behaving tyranical, and I didn't use firearms to stop it, how am I not just using my second ammendment right with another technology: audio surveillance? Originalism works in my favor, yes, albeit in my opinion, but with no bullets spent.

### Outline (remaining to write)

1. Quick intro chapter going over Twitch history and reading faces re: chat, then lead to social media socialism video game times in 2021 as a reason the cenrist Dems may be targeting you...
1. ... especially in light of the recent Dem's failure to secure Abortion vote, light suspicions you held of your actions being what caused their distractions & distrust amongst their own ranks
1. First week of LR -- intro suspicions in meetings re: the above, testing it via verbal dialogue on "mute" like last time, seeing much in that vein
1. Pissed off that you had to go through this bullshit, and relizing that your therapist was involved, talk about the markdown essays
1. Second week -- keep testing the above, get the strongest reaction wrt "the blown cover hair flip moment," being offended that many people were involved and at ages you found offensive, also consider that the hair flip was an attempt to intimidate me via gender egoisms I don't really have (I'm for all skittles haired people of all genders).
1. Weekend after second week -- You're going to have to talk about the Friday Night Loser porn thing. It's become historically important, apparently. Sorry, to the ghost of Ewen Cameron, I'm guessing you thought this shit would die wth you. Alas. Discuss thinking that that wasn't _enough_ to stop what was clearly a financial opportunity, and you hadn't realized it til Saturday morning / afternoon. Discuss realizing the financial thing on Saturday, and realizing the best thing for you to do for your country was to involve wall st and make sure the widest audience saw this backfire in the most spectacular of ways. Talk about _Burn Notice_, and how one of it's central points was that to take down a criminal organization -- particularly one with government connections -- you just have to threaten the leadership, and I made a plan to threaten the leadership's ego while jeopardizing the thing they were selling to their clients: security.
1. Third week -- well, you being weird is one thing, but also, discuss your suspicions with the TV hack, and whether or not that's true it may have influenced a certain side to try and convince me this was "something else" -- discuss the 30 cops vs 1 criminal arrest sideshow outsdie of your apartment, putting the markdown essays onto github
1. Memorial day weekend -- discuss the weird rocky & bowinkle villains you thought were hired models meant to make me think they were "russian spies" or some shit and started to wonder if there are two sides to this clown show. One side is trying to keep this "investigation" as honest as possible, and another side wants to make it hilarious and stupid as fuck. 
1. Fourth week -- shifting from murder talk to corporate "your company's kind of disorganized but that's ok" talk on mute, seeing effects
1. June 4th weekend -- hamburgers, tevas, and shit talking with a side of thinking about keeping calm and celebrity birth-spawn. End with June 5th debit card fiasco, where you knew that there was clearly two sides -- one was honest and wearing a bjork shirt, even if they were investigating me, and the other was just trying to fuck me over anyway they could even if it meant outright fascism like using a state financed investigation to debit card fraud me because I made fun of some rich kid's shoes
1. Think about who would have the money and the access AND the profile to be fascistly stupid af, and check Elon Musk's tweets. Realize this is maybe an attempt by some financial folks + Democrat party workers to lure Elon into donating for Dems and other finance schemes by creating some weird side show around me, realizing I'd be his dream candidate considering my profile to "prove he was right" about "this and that or whatever". But also realize that _some_ people have to be taking this seriously, and wonder if "two sides" are forming, one trying to beguile Elon Musk via his immaturity into some kind of finance scam, and another probably trying to move on from this obvious civil rights nightmare. Make a personal note that if this stops getting weird, and someone like Elon was involved, that means Elon is more mature than I thought. If it keeps getting weird, well, he's probably just another guy who doesn't get jokes and catches weird feelings about it.
1. Last week at live ramp -- quitting, making a cover story about thinking this was a "right wing conspiracy" specifically to provide cover for the Dems, so they could feel like they "got away" with it (provided they actually "left" me alone), making the markdown essays on Bickle Bin Laden, hoping for the best. End on how you thought anyone with two cents of a writer's instict would realize I was making a joke, albiet one that would cover me from a smear of being a "violent leftist anarchist", and the biggest "tell" that this was a joke was the line about Hitler, Mussolini, and Sowell. It was there all along.


# Pt 3.5 -- A flash to the future

### Early morning around 1AM, Sunday September the 25th outside 275 South St and under the FDR between the DSNY and Unlabled city parking areas

There were just a few times in this situation where I was so shocked that I developed tunnel vision.

_All I saw were the flames. Bright, like something out of television._

This was one of them.

I understand things got weird. They essentially were dangling one of my favorite celebrities that their political party has a good connection with, but in a way I found untoward. I didn't like the phrasing of being bucked like a bronco, even if they bribed my barber to say it.

_White, light yellow. Hot, and persistent._

So I pissed you off by rejecting something you were probably not offering, with that celebrity knowing, all from my apartment while under some sort of Reality TV show I didn't want to be on.

_The flames burn almost... like... chemicals?_

You tried clowning me in front of that celebrity when I saw them speak at the Y Uptown, and I made you look foolish for it, and then later that week, while being recorded for a Reality TV show I didn't consent to being on, I made it clear I wasn't going to sign paperwork to be on a show that made me look bad.

_Fire. Just Fire._

I get that pissed you off, I was trying to politely say you were committing crimes. I made it clear I knew you were just trying to cover up the federal investigations you shouldn't have put me on with a Netflix show, and that I wouldn't sign onto it, no matter who the Boss was.

But... after all that... why in god's name would you light a truck on fire outside my apartment?

_There's a truck on fire outside of my apartment. The way it's just staying on fire and with flames that seem that hot indicate they used some kinda chemicals like it's a Hollywood stunt. Typical. This is probably those idiots. I really hope this means this is over and not that it has anything to do with a deck of cards they think is magical._

It was another time where I wish I was psychic, but I was stupified. I just stared. And in my innocence - in thinking the actors positioned against me would one day, just, you know, stop and get a life -- I didn't take photos.

But I'm sure they exist _somewhere_. Video, even.

Personally, I dont like to play around with fire.
# Pt 4 - Post Liveramp, possibly up to the knife incident -- the start of June to early August 2022 

1. Talk about Jesse Sommer + therapist having suspicious communications that felt off and oddly connected, though, with two separate overtones: the intent to exploit and the fear of being exploited, respectively. This proved to you that the Democrats were leveraging every resource they coudl to try and paint me as a psychicatric problem.
1. After being followed in the park, and before the "knife incident", recall making a website that was a joke called [bigbosswatch.com](https://github.com/ogbigboss/bigbossos) as a way to "respond" to being followed in the streets as described in the intro. While making this website, that weird thing with the cockroach that was of a type not native to the area happened, make sure that you read it as a "retaliation" for starting to work on a joke website. Double check dates from notes. After launching the site, they did the thing with the internet connection downing on you and the therapist, leading to the "knife incident."
1. Catch up to the intro, get to the knife, and maybe just hint at the very end about realizing you had a big batch of bootleg DVDs and you were aware a streaming network like Netflix, particularly with their CEO's political leanings, being one of the most likely outcomes, and if you could prove it (this is pre Paula Patton), then you'd know what to do: catch up on some movies, apparently. Just a day in the life of a not spy.
1. You could preface the walk to the police station with this internal monologue: _I love my mom, my dad, and my sister, and I really wish we could have resolved this whole situation in a peaceful way that didn't involve intimidation of my therapist via disabling our internet connections, but if my mom, dad, and sister are trying to play a game as I suspect they are, how can I best protect myself in this situation while ensuring that I don't let them get away with playing games when and where they shouldn't be. If I was wrong, I'd find out and pay some cost, but if it turns out I wasn't wrong, or things wouldn't have ever been this weird between me and my family, which, is saying something. I love them but I'm not going to lose for them if it means they have to win like this. I won't lose to them; but I do love them. So what if the government is involved? It's_ on.

1. Note that your mother's phone call after your therapist appt where the internet connection of both you and your therapist were cut sequentially and theatrically such to intimidate; your mother intimated your presence may be needed in Los Angeles. Realizing I may be on some reality tv concept show, and not wanting to be "pranked" in a city where it's easy to leave someone stranded miles from civilization, compounded with the fact that I don't have a driver's license, made me want to avoid the risk of going to the West Coast for whatever stupid thing this was. So part of my calculation in going with the "knife incident" was to either keep me on the East Coast by circumstance, or, if they wanted to continue playing this game then they're going to have to shoot on location in NYC. I have some conflicts here as a New Yorker; such shit can be very annoying. That said, as a fan of cinema and filmed arts of all kind, if I'm going to be forced onto a reality TV show without my consent, then god damnit it's gonna be shot on location in NYC. No offense, LA. Maybe with a driver's license.
1. I think it might be best to end on the weekend before going to the Grey Lady. Maybe the last moment in the pitch can be when you were about to leave the apartment that Friday (nts: or Saturday? check email and notes), and in your bathroom you were saying out loud to anyone listening: "Look if you have to arrest me that's fine, just no Netflix or Hollywood bullshit, please." Apologies to Paula Patton, of course. I don't think she's bullshit, to be clear. Maybe make the last line an allusion to Paula Patton's appearance.
1. It took a few days, but your certainty of mom's involvement led to a certainty by at least that weekend that this did indeed come from the top, and likely the VP's office, and was likely... sigh... weird. It took seeing Paula Patton to realize that I'm probably best to bring things up directly. Remind and make clear to the reader that you didn't say or mention any Democratic leadership up until that point, particularly within the Biden / Harris admin, though you knew they had to at least be the propspective boss. Their presence, at least VP Harris', felt confirmed to you by your mom's involvement. There's only so many ways my mom's gonna actually lie about something and in a way taht is fun for her, and honestly, I know it sounds stupid, but I know Aparna Mallik, and the only way she would do thsi shit is for the first Indian Female VPOTUS, which is to say, I think she wuld've even turned Hillary Clinton down in a similar position, which isn't to say Hillary would ever do this stupid shit, but regardless, maybe you can leave that unsaid. The real point is you waited months to even acknowledge your suspicions out loud in order for them to save face, then spent most of August talking about grey areas or some shit to get them to know they could just leave - and yet - they didn't
1. Add that you went to the police station beacuse you had a strong feeling the VP's office was involved, due to VP Harris' history in law enforcement, she would have the ability to make a "loyalist" faction of NYPD work for her whim -- if I was right. I went to the precint specifically to make sure ALL or as many of the NYPD knew about this, so I wasn't just facing VP Harris' NYPD Loyalists, and the entire NYPD as much as possible, for objectivity #yespleaseALLcops
# Pt 5 Chapter 1

"Bruce Springsteen" saved my life is probably something that's been said before, and will be said again, about the man's music.

If you had asked me before 2018, I'd of told you I grew up in Jersey, and was familiar with most of his hits, but was really more of a Tom Petty guy.

After 2020, I'd of told you I was a big fan -- I even named a video game after one of his songs, well, sort of, also the Bible I guess, but whatever.

(I probably would've been too shy to say I had been practicing singing three of his songs every night just about for the year of 2019, but I parenthetically digress).

After 2022, I can say with a somewhat clear mind that Bruce Sprintsteen might've saved my life - but not with something stupid like his rock n roll music.

Without Bruce Springsteen, I'm just not sure that Netflix along with the Biden Harris Administration, the KHive DNC, and very likely Barack Obama's Higher Grounds Productions would have been held accountable or in check, such to create a semblance of balance, and I may have suffered a far worse fate because of my leap of faith.

Anyway, thanks Boss. If someone talks shit about you I'm going to maybe get into a fight with them, and then I'm going to get profiled for it in the future where I'm accused of having delusions of being a timeless and legendary Rock n' Roll act. I hope the horn section I hallucinate can be anything close to what you had IRL.
# Potential remaining outline (in parts)

1. Early August 2022 - late september, start with the Boss and end with the Fire. Make Dancing in the Dark jokes as much as possible.
1. Flash forward: November 2022, maybe just include parts of the long ass tell all essay I wrote
1. Late September post truck fire to the week before Halloween


# Pt xx -- Late September (possible intro)

> "Michael Westen: [narration] For a spy, there's no shame in retreat. When faced with a more powerful enemy you're trained to get out of the way and keep moving. It's not about running away or giving up. The goal of any retreat is to find the right place to marshal your resources and make a stand. Military history is filled with stories of small forces taking on larger ones. Whether it's David fighting Goliath or the French Resistance fighting the Nazis, the strategy is basically the same. You have to choose the right ground, deploy your resources carefully, and remember that the greatest weapon in any battle is surprise."

At this point, realizing I had to stay true to my character's word of what I said in early September, I believe I took `the_gg_move` one step further, and introduced recursion, in the seemingly infinite loop I am still in and hope to one day see an end to.

Recursion in computer programming is a deep topic; but at it's surface it's a function, which is like a pre planned play in a sport labeled by a name, but with one caveat -- it can call itself infinitely, until it is ready to reach what some call an exit clause.

```
function play_the_good_game
  try_and_get_my_harassers_to_realize_this_is_a_bad_idea_and_they_should_go_home_before_it_gets_worse

  if my_harassers_keep_harassing_me then
    play_the_good_game
  else if my_harassers_realize_its_legally_politically_socially_and_morally_better_to_stop then
    # nothing happens and the good game ends
  end
end
```

If you're wondering what a hashtag means, well, in many programming languages it's something called a comment. It doesn't actually do anything save for give programmers a chance to write things other than code, such to explain the code they're writing.

So when that line says nothing happens and the good game ends... that's what it means.

Nothing happens. In a code review profesionally, someone would probably point that out and say you could even get rid of two lines of code, since nothing at all happens in that case. You don't need the word `morally` to even be in the function, that way.

Anyway, September in the rain. Writing this in June 2023, some 9 months later, I'm still in this loop somehow. Alas.

1. Flash forward: December 2022 and learning that Yuga labs was a company that was real, reference Lucy Liu movies helping
1. Last week of October to Early December 2022, end on making first video in dropbox series and pontificate on reasons as to why you needed a recorded fiction in case someone else told another fiction about you
1. Flash forward: First visit from people claiming to FBI officers; explain why you thought this was not real, lack of badge numbers, them not wanting to be videotaped, showing up at 8AM on a Saturday, being kind of rude, and explain your thought process and how you couldn't believe they were real and figure'd your bosses or Netflix were playing some joke on you, especially given that IMO the FBI wouldn't want to risk showing up to someone's door appaering politically biased unless the likelihood of a violent crime was indeed provably likely, etc
1. Early December 2022 to mid February 2023: The time I tried to record a version of events that could be plausible in order to make sure somoene else doesn't try to produce another version of events that is indeed not plausible but they can edit in anyway they like; largely because I think my story is better than Netflix's.
1. Flash forward: The getting arrested thing for the above
1. Mid February to late March 2023: Did I get the Democratic party to distract Netflix into allowing Putin to start a war, distract the crypto currency industry into base liquidity issues, distract their own senate majority by not ensuring the right to abortion, AND distract the tech banking sector into base liquidity issues? I mean... I am good looking, but god damn.
1. Flash forward: Probably me writing this shit right now
1. late March 2023 to Mid May 2023: These people have to be kidding right? The Connells, the clampdown, and the TV news
1. Flash forward: ???
1. June 2023
