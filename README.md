# How I Got My Netflix Show Cancelled: A Memoir

## A bogus federal investigation led on by a true crime TV pilot for Netflix starts with a Vice President's reputation and ends with the fall of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. The only thing stopping it from going further into a full scale financial crises? It all depends on what a male witch wants.

## Pitch Outline

### Intro

1. Briefly address being stalked in late July as awkward purely because you were already under a federal investigation for the past 5 months and no one acted like they were going to be violent. 
1. Now there's a creepy girl in a red dress leading you towards white men wearing white shirts who are all staring at you, walking by you intimidatingly. 
1. Be brief, setup the feeling of knowing they're trying to intimidate you, and have the reader wondering (as were you) could the literal Federal Government of the USA be this trashy and dumb, and _violent_ about it? Have them check the year, realize I must be talking about Biden / Harris, etc. Show, lead on, but don't tell too much, it's just an intro. 
1. Underplay your own immediate feelings of being over it -- the reader doesn't know it's big tech and therefore a bunch of dork ass losers aka fight me you fucks you had your chance and you were too scared to do it then weren't you you may have gotten those white tees red oh no. Better for the reader to me titilated by fear a bit, then put together that you, the author, nor the reader should _ever_ be afraid of these Demodorks and the fucking Tech industry. As, if.

### Chapter 1: Vouch

1. Just retell the voch situation. About time you wrote it down now.
1. Focus on being aware but having to (or trying to) hide the fact that you knew it was the Democrats, likely the White House by their coordinations, and that your sister and parents were involved. Focus on juggling your own emotions -- which is trrue -- but again, will begin to undergird for the reader that Reagan was right in spirit, just not language. The scariest thing is a government man showing up to your door? Let's try annoying instead, I think that's a bit more universally true. Then again, these are Democrats. Anyway.
  1.1. You were doing this largely for your family's sake moreso than these politicians though, that's for sure
1. Might be very depressing to write about, especially as the suicidal parts come up.
1. I'm honestly thinking of just writing Mal's parts way down as a "therapist" and nothing more. It may be easier on the reader for Mal to appear less partial than Mal's leanings may insinuate or be of truth. Also, it's definitely the government's fault way before it was Mal's situation.
1. Definitely include emails and end with the idea that the Dems were embarassed -- and you intended for it.
1. Start the theme -- all of your actions fall under the category of "trying to get these dumb fucks to never do this shit again"

### Chapter 2: Liveramp

1. I mean, lol, just try not to sound like you're bragging. Or that you had as much fun as you did. That shit was hilarious though.

### Chapter 3: Post Liveramp, possibly up to the knife incident

1. Hey Jesse! Jesse does NOT get the Mal treatment. Lmfao.
1. Catch up to the intro, get to the knife, and maybe just hint at the very end about realizing you had a big batch of bootleg DVDs and you were aware a streaming network like Netflix, particularly with their CEO's political leanings, being one of the most likely outcomes, and if you could prove it (this is pre Paula Patton), then you'd know what to do: catch up on some movies, apparently. Just a day in the life of a not spy.
