# How I Got My Netflix Show Cancelled: A Memoir

## A bogus federal investigation led on by a true crime TV pilot for Netflix starts with a Vice President's reputation and ends with the fall of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. The only thing stopping it from going further into a full scale financial crises? It all depends on what a male witch wants.

## Pitch Outline

### Intro

1. Briefly address being stalked in late July as awkward purely because you were already under a federal investigation for the past 5 months and no one acted like they were going to be violent. 
1. Now there's a creepy girl in a red dress leading you towards white men wearing white shirts who are all staring at you, walking by you intimidatingly. 
1. Be brief, setup the feeling of knowing they're trying to intimidate you, and have the reader wondering (as were you) could the literal Federal Government of the USA be this trashy and dumb, and _violent_ about it? Have them check the year, realize I must be talking about Biden / Harris, etc. Show, lead on, but don't tell too much, it's just an intro. 
1. Underplay your own immediate feelings of being over it -- the reader doesn't know it's big tech and therefore a bunch of dork ass losers aka fight me you fucks you had your chance and you were too scared to do it then weren't you you may have gotten those white tees red oh no. Better for the reader to me titilated by fear a bit, then put together that you, the author, nor the reader should _ever_ be afraid of these Demodorks. As, if.

### Chapter 1: Vouch

1. Just retell the voch situation. About time you wrote it down now.
1. Focus on being aware but having to (or trying to) hide the fact that you knew it was the Democrats, likely the White House by their coordinations, and that your sister and parents were involved. Focus on juggling your own emotions -- which is trrue -- but again, will begin to undergird for the reader that Reagan was right in spirit, just not language. The scariest thing is a government man showing up to your door? Let's try annoying instead, I think that's a bit more universally true. Then again, these are Democrats. Anyway.
  1.1. You were doing this largely for your family's sake moreso than these politicians though, that's for sure
1. Might be very depressing to write about, especially as the suicidal parts come up.
1. I'm honestly thinking of just writing Mal's parts way down as a "therapist" and nothing more. It may be easier on the reader for Mal to appear less partial than Mal's leanings may insinuate or be of truth. Also, it's definitely the government's fault way before it was Mal's situation.
1. Definitely include emails and end with the idea that the Dems were embarassed -- and you intended for it.
1. Start the theme -- all of your actions fall under the category of "trying to get these dumb fucks to never do this shit again"

### Chapter 2: Liveramp

1. I mean, lol, just try not to sound like you're bragging. Or that you had as much fun as you did. That shit was hilarious though.

### Chapter 3: Post Liveramp, possibly up to the knife incident

1. Hey Jesse! Jesse does NOT get the Mal treatment. Lmfao.
1. Catch up to the intro, get to the knife, and maybe just hint at the very end about realizing you had a big batch of bootleg DVDs and you were aware a streaming network like Netflix, particularly with their CEO's political leanings, being one of the most likely outcomes, and if you could prove it (this is pre Paula Patton), then you'd know what to do: catch up on some movies, apparently. Just a day in the life of a not spy.
1. OR, just stop at being followed in the streets to catch up to the intro. Give a warning that after that, things get weird, involve celebrities, accusations of terrorism, etc. Maybe a good cutoff point for a potential publisher to ask questions, while not having to get to the... more than probably publicly known parts. Exciting! Leave them wanting more!


### Notes for further writing through the entire incident to date

1. Elon's story arc should be one of redemption; he was roped into this and lied to as much as anyone, certainly by me. Sure I'll talk about shitting all over him in November, some of that shit was funny, the lil lo lo stuff, etc. The arc should be in bringing him closer to his mother and family, hopefully, and just wishing the Musks' well, with no reason to be gauche or drab about it. The only reason they may have been involved is because I wanted Wall st folks to know about the situation at Liveramp, it's not really their fault, plus as public figures it worked well for my side of the fiction I was forced to live in. The pitch may have to introduce Elon in terms of immaturity, but given what happened at Twitter etc, I think that's not so bad as long as it implies growth / bringing him closer to family in the end, given my story goes well beyond the initial hurdles at Twitter over Q4 2022, and I'm sure by the time I get published things'll straighten out with the new CEO CTO combo. So in the pitch imply that, should the story continue, it was never really him in charge or his fault (at least in my assumptive fictitious POV) and, well, I was just using the celebrity of his family as I was for so many other people for one reason: not being made a fool for someone else. I think they'd be ok with that. Don't forget to talk about the jealousy you feel at Jack Dorsey's beard, however.



## Alternate concept

It may be better to bring in back story in betwixt incidents, e.g.

1. Intro (stalked in the park)
1. Vouch
1. In between liveramp, suicidal thoughts and growing suspicions
1. FLASHBACK -- 2020 video games, social media, business attempts, DNC spycraft suspicions
1. Liveramp
1. FLASHBACK -- Family basics? (profile on family members maybe)
1. Late June to July, gaslighting via former JAG Jesse Sommer, catch up to intro
1. FLASHBACK -- Idk maybe Tastespace w/ pre JAG Jesse Sommer as a focus, or 
1. August etc
1. FLASHBACK -- David Blaine awkward age gap Stanley Kubrick thing w/ Sparks in College
1. September etc
1. FLASHBACK -- 2017 issues w/ friends and families, estranging
1. October etc
1. FLASHBACK -- We the Lobby, therapy, TPL game project (basically, or maybe literally, the essay written in early Novemeber in rummy repo, to a point)
1. November etc
1. FLASHBACK -- Lenox hill NYU moment
1. December etc
1. FLASHBACK -- Connell's corny ass telling me about how they should make a reality tv show of his life smoking weed and watching TV back in college
1. January etc
1. FLASHBACK --
1. February etc
1. FLASBACK -- Recall listening to Springsteen's _Wrecking Ball_ and the "spooky" thoughts around it (finish November essay brought up pre November)
1. March etc -- lmao bank failures like I'm literally the wrecking ball and I told you about it months ago yall are STUPID (or at least not incorporating biblical events literally conspiring against you as a form of risk analysis, or, too stupid for basic morals, midn your business etc)
1. FLASHBACK -- Connell, Okoye, the Sunken Place and a bit of Sparks 
1. April etc -- start with Connell, apex at central booking, end with TNT sportcasters
1. FLASHBACK -- Reading about Obama's _A Promised Land_ on my toilet in late 2020 and wondering if my game title had anything to do with it
1. May etc


The pitch could honestly be just the first three chapters here, with maybe like an outline on the rest just to be like wtf. Another approach, this way I get to constantly add background information, all of which would be of increasing interest as this becomes some weird show on my past or whatever

### Burn Notice quotes to use

> "You can't choose your intelligence sources. Might be a heroin smuggler, a dictator... or your mom." â€” "Identity" episode, likely Westen

> "Michael Westen: [narration] In a hostage situation, the same things that get you killed will extend your life."

> "Michael Westen: [narration] Military units are a lot like marching bands. Take out the guy conducting the operation, and you'll throw everyone out of sync. Pretty soon all you have left is sound and fury."

> "Michael Westen: [narration] When fighting in the wilderness, the biggest threats are often the ones you don't see: dehydration, exhaustion, and nerves."

> "You'd be surprised how often covert operatives pose as international men of mystery. Fantasies about glamarous covert ops can be extremely useful to exploit. Though, some secret agent fantasies are more useful than others." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from USA Network's _Burn Notice_

> Oleg: You're real Michael Westen, yes?
>
> Michael: Yeah.
>
> Oleg: Back home, your story Russian Intelligence tells to scare. They say you're one name for many people. Special Operations team. They think one person cannot make so much problems.
>
> Michael: Nope. Just me.
> - George Tasudis as Oleg and Jeffrey Donovan as Michael from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

> "Phillip Cowan : [Over the phone]  You want to tell me what the head of the Libyan secret police is doing sending me a fruit basket? I've got the FBI on my front lawn!" - Richard Schiff as Phillip Cowan

> People I work for, they have plans for you... powerful, dangerous people. And, man, are they upset with me.
>
> I misread you, Michael.
> Didn't expect you to buck quite so much.
>
> You're making everyone nervous.
> - Richard Schiff as Phillip Cowan

> [ Michael Narrating  ] When selling yourself as a traitor, you can't be too eager. A good op[erative] will walk away from a recruitment that seems too good to be true.


> [ Michael Narrating  ]
> When you can't win in a fight, sometimes you have to settle for making sure that if you lose, everyone loses. It works for nuclear weapons, it works for me.

> Michael: Because he's an importer. He sells to your competition. I put him out of business, it's a win for both of us. And, if you don't do what I want, I will rain hell down upon you until one of us is dead. And I am really, really good at raining down hell. I want an answer tomorrow.

> Carmelo: Who are you?
> 
> Michael: I'm Michael Westen. I used to be a spy.
> Jeffrey Donovan as etc etc etc and Todd Stashwick as Carmelo Dante

> Carmelo: You take care of this guy, you stay out of my way, we're good. If I ever see your face again, I'll kill you -- bomb or no bomb.
>
> Michael: Agreed.
> Jeffrey Donovan as etc etc etc and Todd Stashwick as Carmelo Dante

> "[Michael Narrating]
> Badly done surveillance, that is, surveillance you notice, can mean a lot of things. Some organizations need intelligence but can't afford to pay for training... some organizations just want you to know they're watching."

> [Michael Narrating] Once the cops pick up a call on a flagged cell, they triangulate its location. From there, they organize and deploy units a process that can take 10 minutes, give or take.
>
> Bad guys don't have that chain of command. They can be anywhere as fast as their wheels can take them.

> "Just tell mike it's not personal, okay? Last time I saw him, there was this kind of, you know, 'do this for me or we're enemies for life' vibe. It scared me a little." - Paul Tei as Barry Burkowski from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

> [ Michael Narrating ] Exploiting an asset is easier when they have a vice... an addiction you can feedâ€“ drugs, money, respect, women.

> "Getting information out of someone who doesn't want to give it up is all about upsetting the target's emotional balance, impairing their judgment. Fear's good for that. Anger's not bad either." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

> [Michael Narrating] Stun guns are a great way to bring down a larger opponent. The only problem is, if you use one on someone who's touching you, you'll zap yourself too.

> [Michael Narrating] The fact is, torture is for sadists and thugs. It's like getting groceries with a flamethrower. It doesn't work, and it makes a mess. Getting useful information is about creating a new reality for the interrogation subject with no hope of escape or freedom. You control every aspect of their world. How they eat, where they sleep. Even whether it's day or night. When it's time to ask questions, you want them disoriented, anxious, wondering who you are and what you can do to them. You have to make them understand that their entire future, their hopes, their dreams... every breath they will ever take from then on it all depends on one thing.

> This one might be good to introduce the Ellen Saroterelli character

> Sam: I mean, this guy's gulag tough. I've seen the type. Now, after a month, when he's been in isolation so long he's howling at the moon, you know, maybe.
>
> Michael: We got three days, Sam.
>
> Sam: Well, that's why I think our best bet might be to have a friend inside. They speak the same language. Someone to talk to, confide in.

> [Michael Narrating] One issue in dealing with modern criminal gangs is that their operations are diversified. The heat shielding you hope is hiding a human smuggling operation could be hiding radio emissions from software pirating computers.

_Season 1 Episode 1_

> * use to describe how a computer programmer could be framed easily by their company or the government using API keys, analogies are easy *
>
> Javier: Last month, there was a robbery. Twenty-two million in odd jewelry and antiques. It was-- It was very bad.
>
> Michael: Well, looks like the police are into it. Says here they're talking to persons of interest.
> *Michael pauses, looks at Javier*
> You're a person of interest.
>
> Javier: The police asked me questions. When this happened, I was at home watching TV with my kid. The security code they used for the alarm-- it's the master code-- my code... It looks bad.
>
> Michael: Yeah, that looks pretty bad.

> Michael Narrating: Powerful people don't like being pushed around. You can never quite predict what they're going to do... or have their washed-out Special Forces security guys do.

> Michael Narrating: Home court advantage counts for a lot. You never know what's going to happen. You prepare for everything. Most bad guys expect you to just sit there and wait for them... like those are the rules or something.

> Michael: Fiona, you were supposed to stop the car, not blow it into the Everglades. What happened to shorting the ignition?
>
> Fiona: Well, you said disable. It's not going anywhere.

> Michael Narrating: Go after a group of people directly, and they pull together. They get stronger. Taking on a tight-knit group is about making them turn on each other. You plant the seeds of distrust and watch them grow.

> * this is obviously for the truck fire chapter should I get there *
> Fiona: I know you're angry, Michael. But I know that an exploding car... can throw a man off balance.

> Michael narrating: I don't much like dealing with paranoids. They get erratic, make bad decisions. Of course, that can be a help when you need them to make a bad decision.

> Michael narrating: if it looks like you're about to get into a fight that could get you killed, try starting another one.

> Michael narrating: When enough people hate you, sometimes the only move is to just stand in the middle and hope they kill each other before they kill you.

> Michael: What has he been doing since he was last here?
>
> Sam: Well, my fed buddy's been trackin' his credit card. Your sniper's in Daytona, hitting all the strip clubs. Mike, do you think he's just blowing off steam before he starts shooting?

> Michael: They always hire extra security.
>
> Lesher: Extra security, aside from you?
>
> Michael: They got two more guys locked and loaded-- watchers watching the watchers. Can you believe that? For one girl.
>
> Lesher: Two more guards. Seriously?
>
> Michael: See for yourself. They got more money than sense.

> Sam: So I tried to get ears on her with the directional mike, but whenever they're out in the open, it's just small talk.

> [Michael Narrating] When someone turns you into an asset, their main weapon is fear. If you fear poverty or exposure or death, that's what they use against you.
>
> Their worst nightmare, then, is an asset with no fear.

> [ Michael Narrating  ]
> Blowing an operation is a delicate business.
>
> You have to convince your opponent to abandon his plans, make a case that the smart move is to just pack up and go home.
>
> Problem is, even when you do your job well, people don't always go with the smart move.

> "You thought you could kill me? I gave you a chance to be redeemed, but you turned your back! These are your sins, Lesher, here on this paper."
> - Michael acting undercover as an ex special forces guy turned security guard turned religious zealot

> [ Michael Narrating  ]
> There's a reason they call the spy trade the hall of mirrors. You can never know for sure whether you're in control or you're being played, but if you do it long enough, you learn to trust your instincts.
>
> Michael: It's a setup.

> Michael: "I want answers! I want my life back!"

> [Michael Narrating]
> There's a saying in interrogation: "Violence perceived is violence achieved." You don't want someone screaming. You want him asking questions, asking "What is he doing with that knife?"

> [Michael Narrating] In covert work, you try to make friends with the bad guys. But sometimes you just can't pull it off.
>
> Once it's clear you're not going to be friends you have to resolve the situation as quickly and as cleanly as possible.
>
> Sometimes you can't pull that off either.

> [Michael Narrating]
> Using sound to determine an enemy's position is one of the oldest techniques in war, whether it's putting an ear to the ground or bouncing sonar off a submarine.
>
> If you can get your enemy on the phone that opens up new possibilities. Hook up your cell phone to an amplifier and a computer that can analyze sound, and you have a powerful weapon if you know how to use it.

> [Michael Narrating]
> Running an operation is like poker. Ideally, you've got good cards and you play them well. When your cards are bad, though, you have to know how to bluff.

> Fiona: If they went off the balcony...
> Michael: I could check the security cameras at the businesses along the river.
>
> Fiona: You're really gonna do this? Hunt them down?
> Michael: Worth a try.

> "We recruited you because you're a good liar. Guess we can't complain too much when you lie to us. Hmm? But know this. One way or another... I expect results. Understand?" - Tricia Helfer as Carla Baxter

> [Michael Narrating] When you've spent enough time as an operative, recovering from a brush with death isn't about an appointment with the psychiatrist or a week in Hawai.
>
> It's about having a purpose, whether it's something to fight... or someone to hunt.

> [Michael Narrating] There's an element of theater in any offensive campaign. It's not just abou bullets and bodies. Killing people usually creates more problems than it solves. It's about undermining your enemy's will to fight, destroying the morale of his troops, sending the message that fighting back is useless because the battle is already lost.

> Fiona: Michael McBride.
>
> Michael: Michael McBride.
>
> Fiona: Sometimes I wonder if he's the one I fell in love with.
>
> Michael: I wouldn't be surprised. We caused a lot of mayhem, you and I. He was your type of guy.
>
> Fiona: Yes, he was. Where did he go?
>
> Michael: Oh, you know how it is with cover IDs. You become who you need to be.
>
> Fiona: And everyone gets to guess who you really are.
