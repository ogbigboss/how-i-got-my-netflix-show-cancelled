> "In intelligence work, surveillance is called coverage. It's like basketball; you can run zone defense or man-to-man. Man-to-man is risky; follow someone too long and they're going to get suspicious. Zone is usually the way to go. Stay put and let targets come to you. Less obvious, easier on the feet... and you can catch up on your celebrity gossip." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

_Late July 2022_

After a few years, most of us who lived in a big city like New York form a way to confirm their paranoias about whether or not that weird person who's been walking behind them is indeed _following_ them. One of my tricks, like many, is to pull out a cell phone or something to futz with, pause walking to begin futzing, and wait for the person to (hopefully) keep walking past.

The creepy short brown haired girl in the red dress who was just a little too *close* to me not only walked past, but as I began to walk forward, she seemed to look back at me with a coy glance before turning into the park on Essex st. before Canal as I was walking back to my South St. apartment in the Lower East Side.

My mind flashed back to March, when I was suspicious of the federal government being suspicious of me being a spy because of a mishap due to audio surveillance while working from home for a tech company. Way over the top, unrealistic flirting seemed like a fair play entrapment tactic, but that was March, during the first federal investigation, and this was July, after the second federal investigation went awry (for the feds), and in both cases, I looked like a hot mess - mostly on purpose, flirting while under fear of entrapment seemed unejoyable, but also, I am a man.

Anyway, why would the feds try the first trick that didn't work the first time again months later?

As the creepy short brown haired girl in the red dress walked into the park, she took a second to glance further down to the corner of Essex st. by the benches. I saw in that direction a collection of young men, at least 4 or 5, all wearing the same clean white t shirt, and similar pants. While I assumed they could be connected, I couldn't imagine why the feds would dress up a bunch of young men in a psuedo clockwork orange outfit, and I also remembered there was a small playhouse up the street behind me on Grand. Maybe they were in a staged version of clockwork orange?

But why, from about 50 ft away, did it feel like they were all shoulders pointed in my direction, looking at me or the girl?

New Yorkers and those from other dense cities also have a way of figuring out if that gang of men are oggling you in a threatening way down the street or not -- my favorite is crossing the street to see if they follow.

Two men begin to cross, and purposelly eye me the whole time. I wait til we're about 15 feet apart and on the same side of Essex st to look up.

The man on the left was very pretty and had pectoral muscles that would look great in a photo but revealed little in terms of atheltic prowess other than that the guy bench presses, and probably had that day. He also had a very clean haircut with a middle part. He walked with a wide swagger which was either meant to intimidate as he was staring me down, or was a tip that he was a west coaster.

To his right was a shorter, nerdier looking man whom I had identified in early June as part of the second federal investigation at the second tech company I worked for that year whom I had nicknamed "Tevas" to those listening to me under audio surveillance, largely as a way to make fun of him for being the only tech guy amongst a crowd of law enforcement employees, public and private. I knew it'd hurt his feelings at the time if I made fun of his open toed sandals that most New Yorkers just... wouldn't.

Tevas looked at me, open mouthed, with a face that I believe was meant to intimidate but only revealed his own fear of losing social face in a situation involving me, again.

He had changed out of his Tevas and was now wearing combat boots.

Sending some kids from the west coast to make me feel scared was... something certainly, but I couldn't imagine why the Federal Government would think that would work after normative bogus investigation tactics didn't.

What, were they TV producers or something?

I took a large, _Arrested Development_-with-the-_Charlie Brown_-music-in-the-background sigh on the corner of Canal and Essex, directly across from the remains of the white shirt gang. I got a chicken sandwich, then on the walk home up Canal, I saw the creepy brunette ina red dress again, she made a point to look at me with a big frown, as though I had just disappointed her. I tried giving her a "what the fuck is wrong with you" look, and walked home, where I chastised those potentially audio surveilling me for sexism in operational tactics.

Given everything that happened in the past few months, along with the Federal Government denying the right to abortion despite trying to pass a law codifying it, it seemed like the right move. And just in case I was right about the TV producer thing, in the back of my mind, I remembered the large collection of stolen and bootleg DVDs I had in my closet.
