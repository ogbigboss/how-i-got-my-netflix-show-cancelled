# Intro

### Goals

1. Briefly address being stalked in late July as awkward purely because you were already under a federal investigation for the past 5 months and no one acted like they were going to be violent. 
1. Now there's a creepy girl in a red dress leading you towards white men wearing white shirts who are all staring at you, walking by you intimidatingly. 
1. Be brief, setup the feeling of knowing they're trying to intimidate you, and have the reader wondering (as were you) could the literal Federal Government of the USA be this trashy and dumb, and _violent_ about it? Have them check the year, realize I must be talking about Biden / Harris, etc. Show, lead on, but don't tell too much, it's just an intro. 
1. Underplay your own immediate feelings of being over it -- the reader doesn't know it's big tech and therefore a bunch of dork ass losers aka fight me you fucks you had your chance and you were too scared to do it then weren't you you may have gotten those white tees red oh no. Better for the reader to me titilated by fear a bit, then put together that you, the author, nor the reader should _ever_ be afraid of these Demodorks. As, if.
