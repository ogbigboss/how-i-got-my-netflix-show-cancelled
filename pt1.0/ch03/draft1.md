# Pt 1 ch 3 -- Second week at Vouch (2/20/22)

My second week was, all things considered, normal, in that my second week at most companies I spend my time assessing the company itself as much as I can against any workload assigned. At that point, I had the central code bases setup on my computer and running, and had a decent idea of how the code reflected against the things and behaviors presented on the screen in front of me.

There's a tool many developers use called `git` which is a VCS, or Version Control System. Developers use `git` and tools like to sequentially add and track changes to code in a project and within a team; it could be thought of as a shared Google Doc of sort, just for code, and with a lot more formality.

The formality gives developers a log of changes that is easily reviewable. In fact, running the command `git blame` and supplying both a filename and a line number will tell you the history of that line of code; who changed it, when, and what they had to say about it. The keyword `blame` is perhaps a bit unfortunate and was a joke at the time of it's inception in 90s.

That said, `git blame` is my favorite tool for assessing a company against it's codebase. Along with `git log`, you can easily see not just what code went through the most changes, but _who_ makes the most important changes in code. One tell tale sign of a poorly run company, in a general sense, is employee attrition -- do people not stay at the company for long?

At Vouch, when looking at their codebase, there were several names that read important to the code, that simply weren't present at the company. Asking about them got a nervous look at best, and generally current employees don't like talking about previous ones - particularly if they left out of disapointment.

Disappointment from a developer's point of view is easy to track with `git log` and `git blame` - most developers like myself are, if anything, overly exuberant in the English messages we leave when we "commit" code. At the beggining, like most employees, the exuberant developer _over_ writes.

However, over time, the exuberant new developer becomes more aclimated to the fact that no one listens to them, and adjusts their messages accordingly.

Soon, massive code changes are accompanied with one to two word commit messages, with major code alterations being paired with the explanation of "hot fix", where only months ago the formerly exuberant developer was writing paragraphs to explain lines of code changes.

And then, they quit, or from my perspective, were no longer part of the company.

By my second week at Vouch, I had diagnosed all of these things in previous developers as well as my current team mates, particularly Tony Thompson, who had a similar set of skills to me as a developer and I was to work closely with. This disheartened me to say the least.

But code is only one way to judge the internal behaviors of a tech firm. The other way is seeing how clear the _process for requesting code changes_, in any form, is.

...

That Monday or Tuesday I was invited to a shared Google Doc discussing a large tech change to the way insurance plans were categorized. The doc was exhaustive, multiple pages, and seemed to be a way for the "non tech leadership" to clarify with the tech people what can and can't be built alongside business goals - pretty normal.

The Google Doc was shared amongst most of the development leadership, which included me I suppose but was created before my joining quite clearly, and was also shared amongst the company's C suite employees.

The C levels were making quite a lot of comments and conversation in the google doc.

The surprising thing to me? None of the developers matched the conversation; in fact, in seemed like most did not know or were not willing to speak to leadership at the C level, on a document meant to spark exactly that conversation.

This meant one of two things to me:

```
1. The developers here, despite being rather normal and amicable in comparison to most stereotypes, for some reason turn to stone faced nerds that are afraid to talk to company leadership for _some_ reason

2. That Director named Ronnie who left was probably very important to communicating between leadership and tech, and now that she's gone, literally no one knows how to talk to anyone, and they're also afraid for _some_ reason
```

Given that I felt the company leadership _may_ have leveraged federal resources in an attempt to imagine me as a criminal, I was afraid to imagine the reasons my co workers were also afraid to talk to the company leadership.

That, or, the developers had given up trying to communicate to the leadership, for _some_ reason.

Either way, Vouch, despite it's pedigree and financing, was clearly just another run of the mill disorganized tech company that hides it's lack off efficiency or professionality behind investor graft to make investment appear as value without creating the actual value it represents. Which, is typical.

What kept me from quitting right then and there was my finances, and that I could deal with typical, if it meant a good paycheck. My coworkers were.

That said, while Vouch's lack of professional standards with regards to technology is rather pro forma for most tech companies, particularly startups, I still had to wonder if all of the employees go through a "covert" federal investigation as a matter of routine as well. But, at that point, I could have been wrong about my assumptions, or at least I hoped.

The last thing I found funny in the Google doc was this: the CIO, a John Wallace, made numerous typos; spelling and grammar. Given that he is a top level employee and a leader representing Insurance -- the one thing that kept this company from just being tech, after all -- I thought his lack of attention to detail was alarming, and I do believe I said something out loud about it.

...

My second week at Vouch, like the first, involved several "onboarding" meetings to introduce me to the various departments and leaders of the company. My boss' boss, the Chief Product Officer, was another Indian man named Rajat Kongovi, the same man who I felt had hinted towards authentication in a strange way a week before in an email. His onboarding meeting to represent our shared internal department of Product seemed fine, save for one comment about his fellow C Suite board member, John Wallace.

Rajat said something like this about John:

> And one thing our CIO John Wallace likes to say is "I've never seen a risk I didn't like taking."

Normally, board members take the time to speak positively on each other. This, I felt, was a bit awkward -- an _insurance_ guy is supposed to be a big risk taker?

I was new to business insurance, but that seemed awkward.

Internally, I began to wonder the following:

_Is Rajat trying to hint that John Wallace took my internet connection down, and perhaps had me investigated, knowing the risk would be that I wasn't a criminal and they had no actual evidence, but, since he likes taking risks..._

Also,

_Is Rajat trying to again as I suspected last week "look out" for another Indian guy? If so, why wouldn't he be an adult about it, as well as my boss' boss, and just be direct if there was any issue?_

Felt, shady, to me.

...

Another onboarding meeting, and one I was anticipating learning a lot about being that I had no perception prior to vouch about the "insurance indsutry" in general, was the onboarding meeting for the insurance department.

Given what Rajat just said, as well as my suspicions, as well as wondering "how does a white C level not use proper english in online documents", I was looking forward to this meeting because it was to be led by John Wallace, the CIO himself.

John Wallace did not lead the meeting, and instead sent a female subordinate to do so in his stead. She was nice and informative, but his lack of presence wasn't the weirdest thing about the meeting.

I was onboarding with about 4-5 other people, all outside of my new team led by Eloise, so these were the only meetings I had with them, but I had had a few by that time.

This meeting had one extra screen waiting in the google hangout. I remember thinking it was odd; the camera seemed positioned somewhere near the ceiling and was pointed down towards the floor. I believe the name tag read "Chicago office." I, and the rest of the onboarders, at one point identify that there's an "extra" camera, at which point, something moves on the camera, and it's clear the camera is pointing down - at the _top_ of a young blonde woman's head.

She addresses the audience that has discovered her, tilting her head slightly up but not enough to reveal he rface, and says she's from the HR department, and makes some excuse as to why she was there though not onboarding. She stays for awhile.

One thought comes to mind:

_Did John Wallace hide from this meeting given what I said about his grammar issues as well as my possible reaction to Rajat's quoting him, and send someone to "sit in" on the meeting so he could observe everyone on camera without being seen?_

Ok, sure, but why was she hiding her face? And does John Wallace, out of all the C levels, being the one that oeprates in Chicago -- does he have expanded abilities to manipulate employees given his distance away from other C levels, whom were mostly on the west coast?

It was weird, but then the meeting about insurance started, and I had to learn about premiums.

...

The strangest meeting would be the one led by the company's legal counsel whom I would get to know later, Ms. Kelly Wulff. She handled the company's issues as a GC I believe but also provided advisement towards their business processes to some extent wrt "the law" and "insurance."

Which, was normal.

What wasn't normal was that she, a female lawyer, in 2022, 2 years into a pandemic for a company that had been remote for just as long if not longer, wasn't adjusting her camera lighting and half her face was hidden.

I felt like I was watching a film noir villain in the visage of a "Karen" stereotype.

There's no way she, given her career and gender, did not know that pulling the blinds on her window would hide half her face due to the web cam adjusting to the off balanced light.

We all know this now after Covid. You close the curtain and turn a light on inside, or you pull the curtain to allow light in if it won't overbear your other side.

A _lawyer_ that works remotely would not be able to have meetings regularly hiding their face, and it may be sexist, but in my opinion most female lawyer's wouldn't _risk_ being seen as "shady."

Strange, but was one C level trying to literally hide their face from me, and were they instructing an HR person as well as the legal counsel of the company to also... hide their face from me?

I couldn't help but feel certain that given the times, her position and gender, Ms. Kelly Wulff had to be going for that lighting more so than happen stance her way into it.

It's an awful way to introduce yourself to new employees at any rate. She was very nice, lighting aside however, and informative at that.

Had I nothing else to reflect on, I probably wouldn't worry about the light reflections in Ms. Wulff's room, but, things began to add up to a strange conclusion.

It wouldn't be the last time I felt Ms. Wulff was hiding someone from me, if not herself.

...

Friday morning, 2/25/2022, I started my day like I did back then: reading the news on the iPad in my bathroom while on the toilet. 

As the year passed, I would stop this, largely because I was afraid of finding out what other idiot in the political-journalist sphere wanted to wink at my Netflix situation in a cute way, but that's now, not then.

I remember being shocked to read that Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, began what is now the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, but not surprised. Over the past 8 years or so, a regular article would be Putin moving tanks or military equipment towards the western border of Russia, and international concern would grow, and move on. I remember thinking that I guess this is what all that tank movement was for, but sighing at yet another bloody conflict in the news.

At the time, I was glad to be able to turn the iPad off and get back to my normal life, pretending the news was a separate item that I couldn't affect.

I'm no longer so sure.

A little after noon ET was my small team's daily meeting, such to accomodate the west coasters. Eloise Jones, my manager whom I felt was a little more talkative and informative than normal last Friday, seems to say something which I read as uncomfortable and forced on her part -- as though someone asked -- and personally, I found shocking.

With only so much as the prompt of "sharing stories," Eloise begins to say something like the following:

> "I studied Russian language in college, and the CIA asked me do translation for them. Which is only a serious thing if you really think Vladimir Putin is a threat."

I remember flinching hard, and looking out the window to try and compose my thoughts.

`Uh... does she not know about the conflict? Did she not read the news? Why does Eloise seem oddly excited in a way that says to me she's hiding something? Did someone ask her to say this? And if they did... did _they_ not know about the conflict?`

There's a pause, and since it's a group web call, I can't say Eloise was looking right at me, but I felt like people were waiting for _someone_ to respond. I didn't, didn't mention anything further about politics or the war, and went on with my day, shell shocked by not just the news on my iPad but the potential insinuation of a tech manager not only bringing up politics at work (more an employee thing if ever), but suggesting that _Vladimir Putin wasn't a threat_.

Many things were not right with my world and remain so.

...

I've alluded for the first time in this chapter to my life potentially having been entagled with the operations of well, the political news cycle many of us are addicted to.

Just call me your pusherman, I guess. This is all theory and conjecture, however.

The darkest theory I can construe would have to be this:

`During my first week at Vouch, the company attempted to investigate me alongside the Federal government, utilizing overreach to which I responded to by lying. In order to justify the overreach, the company or the federal government began spreading the idea that I could be "working with Russia", in reflection of their own political ambitions. However, given this happened via internet comms, Russian intelligence may have picked up on this. Realizing I do not have any connection to Russian intelligence, and realizing that the US Gov't broke their own constitution in pursuing me, perhaps Vladimir Putin started a war simply because he knew the US Gov't could be held at arms length via the blackmail of this situation, which Eloise is now being asked to validate on behalf of those that investigated me under false and perhaps illegal pretenses.`

However, I was nowhere near that theory back then because the Ukrainian - Russian conflict hadn't persisted to the point it is has today: nearly a million lives have been lost on both sides, international economics and food supplies have been endangered, and talk of a shifting world order has come to light yet again because of it.

(Not to mention my own continuing conflict with political and private actors attempting to smear me via the utility of a reality TV true crime they may have focused on me when I never actually committed a crime, not a reality TV worthy one at least, to which this memoir becomes focused on in later sections.)

For the most part, I thought my bosses were being idiots, and could use a reminder that to me, this was a joke.

I would later read that Ukraine's leader, Zelensky, was himself a comedian.

It didn't and it doens't make me laugh.

Reader, let me be clear: If I have been a precusor to the conflict in Ukraine, then it's my duty as a Global Citizen to make sure my story is as well known as possible such to prevent digital "intelligence" from being misused by politicans and businesspeople such that a greater conflict, that potential WWIII, could possibly be avoided, and it's the main reason I'm writing this memoir today.

But, reader, to be clear: at the time, late February 2022, I was mostly trying to keep things light hearted and myself employable.
