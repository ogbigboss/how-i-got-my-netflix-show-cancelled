# Pt 1 Ch 8 - A break to describe the Biden / Harris admin's motivations against me and potential relationships with Netflix and my employer Vouch

> "They spent time retweeting my posts and calling me a white supremacist, a coon and all sorts of derogatory names, fueling others who began to DM me telling me I was a sell out because I was Black and I should’ve killed myself when I had the chance," Jeffrey said. "I was mocked and harassed for being a sexual assault survivor, a domestic abuse survivor, and was told by the KHive that it was good for me and they hope it happens again, since I don’t support Harris." - Luverta Jeffrey, former black female Kamala Harris supporter, as quoted in the [huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-khive-toxic-side_n_5f4fa573c5b69eb5c037473e)

I joined Facebook a year after it was made and my first year before college, 2004. It was funny; I made a long joke name for myself that was funny. At some point early on, I met someone who said "oh, you're that person with the funny name on facebook." They were being honest, they thought it was funny too.

But I felt funny in a different way -- _you know me for that, but I'm right here, that's weird_ -- I look back on it as the first time I felt like I could do without social media. I quit I believe for the first time in 2007, and then several times until around perhaps the 2010s when if I signed on, it would have been for professional web development purposes only.

Things like twitter or instagram never really "hooked" me, and again, I had latent fascinations like many people that passed until, well, I needed to use their APIs for some job as a web developer.

Reader, I am not like everyone else in society as a result. I began to realize this in 2017, but moreso in 2020, as I re-engaged with social media.

From 2017-2020, most of my focus was on game development, in an explicit attempt to avoid the real world, which didn't last, and was rather hard to avoid given the "trending" nature of social media and our own society.

By 2020, I decided to uptick my sporadic social media status and attempt to parlay the "social media left", a group of people largely identifying as Bernie Sanders supporters, into a way to prove an entrepreunerial idea of mine tying video games to charity and support systems outside of the video game itself. The kids seemed to dig it, and I thought it was a great way to keep the energy that Sanders' primary campaign built up, but after he had stepped out of the primary.

What I wasn't prepared for was the duality of society that social media has introduced -- followers are nice, likes are special, and going viral is the goal -- but between all of that, if you can shit on someone else and feel like you're better than them, then social media will make that available to you.

I left the social media left in 2021 feeling that this toxicity was apolitical; it had nothing to do with politics, and it had eveyrthing to do with a pursuit of fame I coudln't understand.

Reader, I believe that toxicity and pursuit of fame that social media has come to define, one in which I was unaware of until 2020 in terms of degrees, has absolutely infilitrated the psychology of the Biden / Harris administration to the point where practical politics is impossible as they are spending time, tax dollars, and DNC assets in an attempt to become Netflix famous by smearing their political opponents -- even and especially when thyr'e private citizens, and then the Biden / Harris administration feels like they can use the law to smear them.

Pure fascism has come to America, and it wants to be televised.

...

Reader, here are the reasons I am suspicious that the DNC, led by the Biden / Harris admin and the "KHive", has since at most January 2022 been targeting me via the mechanism of a Netflix show formerly based on the hope that I would be connected to the behaviors of the Razzlekhan folks.

1. In 2020, I attempted to raise funds for COVID 19 and Climate Change by organizing -- after the Democratic primary -- a small group of mostly Sanders supporters who had varied degrees of "internet fame" in representing a group of nearly 3 dozen "e-celebs" I'll refer to from here on as the "social media left" -- I had no true following before or after this, but I was able to get the attention of many of the social media left given the idea, which was to simultaenousely raise money as well as crowd fund a video game whose intent would be to continue to raise money for various groups and charities. I began on the "social media left" feeling that the lack of an active campaign would be a good segway, though I had, due to a lack of experience, underestimated the "social" aspects, particularly the toxic ones, that take place on social media, and abandoned the project in 2021. It was of minor note then but I was suspicious at the time of possible DNC sabateouring from within the people I was working with, though again, I thought little of this beyond paranoia at the time.

2. In the beggining of 2022, Netflix's CEO was Reed Hastings. Per the NYT:

> "Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, also ranked among the largest donors to Future Forward, a Democratic-aligned super PAC that reportedly spent over (00 million in support of President-elect Biden.)" [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/future-forward-super-pac.html) via [Infleunce Watch](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/reed-hastings/#:~:text=Hastings%20and%20Quillin%20were%20among,Warnock%20(D%2DGA).)

Netflix also had several contractual relationships with former President Barack Obama's "Higher Ground" productions company, offering several ways the center right DNC wing led by the Biden / Harris administration in the White house and Barack Obama outside of it a way to connect directly with Netflix.

The CEO at Vouch where I worked at the time was Sam Hodges, formerly appointed to the Obama / Biden administration via the Secretary of Commerce, giving him a slight but definitive connection to the current POTUS as well as former POTUS Obama.

This connected me, via Vouch, to Sam Hodges, who was connected to the Obama / Biden admin, where Obama has active connections to Netflix, all while Razzlekhan had just been arrested by the Biden / Harris DOJ in 2022 and made into a Netflix special. Kevin Bacon could never.

3. I came up with the idea for the video game mentioned before in late 2018, and called it _The Promised Land_ largely out of difficulty thinking of anything else and wanting to focus on the programming moreso at the time. I was also listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen, someone who at the time was I believe making a podcast with the former President Barack Obama. In late 2020, after connecting with several of the "social media left", I was somewhat surpised to see Obama had named his latest book _A Promised Land_ and privately mused that it woudl be funny if he was someone spying on me, thought I was _way_ more influential or representatitve of a social media war than I was, and decided to "rib me" with a book title. Other than Obama's book being somewhat chastised politely as "not his best effort" and at worst as "the one where he reveals he's still sexually frustrated by being rejected in college and somehow blames it on socialism", I couldn't think of why that title was chosen, given it's lack of conenctions to the Springsteen song or the biblical reference. But, I didn't think much of it at the time, similar to my suspicions of DNC sabateouring.

4. In retrospect, my direct boss at Vouch Eloise's forced questioning and "oversharing" of her own relationship history as well as an in company sexual harrassment situation that was resolved in several employees leaving was a way for whomeever was telling her what to say to see if I'd react sexistly. Any behavior easily categorizable as "bait for cheap claims of sexism" was clearly read by me as a tactic to better portray me as a "Bernie Bro" and made me realize the more it occurred in various degrees that the KHive wing of the DNC was likely more in charge than not, and this was due to bitterness over social media wars they wished I took more place in than I did.

5. In order to feel like I _did_ play a role in their social media wars, as well as to amplify the need for drastic, CIA style investigations into a US citizen, the KHive wing of the DNC attempted to paint connections between me and Russia by way of my computer profession being an indicator that I must "be a hacker" despite my strong suspicions that they couldn't really define what that is. This combination made me potential bait with someone that has authority in both the KHIVe DNC as well as somewhere in the White House itself ti attempt to crucify me simply for the opportunity I posed. If I hadn't been a computer programmer, I probably wouldn't have been targeted as a potential "Russian Hacker" by the DNC McKhartyistHive.

6. I believe small portions of the Cryptocurrency industry which employed me in 2020 were encouraged to point a finger at me early in 2022 in order to justify connecting me to Razzlekhan, at least for an investigation. After that made the DNC Khive look bad internally in Washington DC, they continued to entrap larger and larger pockets of the Cryptocurrency industry in attempting to crucify me. This distacted them all to the point that I believe the DNC Khive led the Cryptocurrency industry to the liquidity failures in various Crypto markets as 2022 went on.

7. More importantly to me, I think this insane series of events led VP Kamala Harris to forgo her responsibilty as the VPOTUS to deal with congress in passing major legislation. It's possible Senator Manchin, as a man, took offense to the attempt to paint me as a sexist via the utility of intelligence services that were beguiled into criminality while investigating due to Netflix, and voted against the Abortion bill. Either way I have serious concerns that the DNC KHive distracted the Biden / Harris administration in attempting to crucify me in early 2022 to the degree that they lapsed securing the right to abortion despite having a Senate majority. The irony of the Roe v. Wade reversal concerning the lack of a true right to privacy was never lost on me.

...


Reader, I write this in 2023 facing criminal charges brought up in the context of me spending my late 2022 and early 2023 making a series of dropbox videos in the style of a "confessional" outlining these events. I did this largely as a way to clear my name should anyone try and smear it; had the parties I felt were harassing me simply left or provided evidence they were stopping their behaviors, I would have stopped making the videos, and if they can at some point, I could even disavow them. But until then, I'm pretty certain my current situation is not necessarily because of what happened at Vouch, but what's happening to this country: _partisan division over practical politics_. Over social media, no less.

Now, in 2023, I may be facing time or at least a life of always being labeled a criminal simply for trying to make a publicly accessible video recording of not my proof of anything in fact; but what remains a fiction until proven true: my story. All I know is that I was acting, and talking about acting, and acting while talking about acting - but on my own recording devices, not their's.

This has, clearly, and perhaps unfortunately, all been a big joke to me. Haven't you been reading? Not everyone finds me funny, sad but true.

Yes, the charges literally have to do with the video series. And yes, I'm writing this memoir literally as a way to keep my name clear before anything more can happen to me while confined or otherwise.

But that's 2023. Let's get back to early March 2022.
