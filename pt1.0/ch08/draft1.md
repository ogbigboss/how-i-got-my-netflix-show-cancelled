# Pt 1 Ch 8 - A break to describe the Biden / Harris admin's motivations against me and potential relationships with Netflix and my employer Vouch

> "They spent time retweeting my posts and calling me a white supremacist, a coon and all sorts of derogatory names, fueling others who began to DM me telling me I was a sell out because I was Black and I should’ve killed myself when I had the chance," Jeffrey said. "I was mocked and harassed for being a sexual assault survivor, a domestic abuse survivor, and was told by the KHive that it was good for me and they hope it happens again, since I don’t support Harris." - Luverta Jeffrey, former black female Kamala Harris supporter, as quoted in the [huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-khive-toxic-side_n_5f4fa573c5b69eb5c037473e)

*start with your own lack of social media usage, joining facebook in '04, quitting the first time in '07, and not really using social media in earnest until 2017 for the idea of game development. In 2020, you started reaching out to "social media socialists" well after the Demoractic primary was over, and that was your first real foray into social media. use the KHive's reputation against them as you can't really be lumped into toxic bernie bro people as you weren't even a social media person before 2020, and I'm guessing all the "let's tell other black women to kill themselves after we find out they tweeted about being sexual assault victims" is something the KHivers didn't earn from Kamala but from social media itself, something you jsut don't get down on*

I joined Facebook a year after it was made and my first year before college, 2004. It was funny; I made a long joke name for myself that was funny. At some point early on, I met someone who said "oh, you're that person with the funny name on facebook." They were being honest, they thought it was funny too.

But I felt funny in a different way -- _you know me for that, but I'm right here, that's weird_ -- I look back on it as the first time I felt like I could do without social media. I quit I believe for the first time in 2007, and then several times until around perhaps the 2010s when if I signed on, it would have been for professional web development purposes only.

Things like twitter or instagram never really "hooked" me, and again, I had latent fascinations like many people that passed until, well, I needed to use their APIs for some job as a web developer.

Reader, I am not like everyone else in society as a result. I began to realize this in 2017, but moreso in 2020, as I re-engaged with social media.

From 2017-2020, most of my focus was on game development, in an explicit attempt to avoid the real world, which didn't last, and was rather hard to avoid given the "trending" nature of social media and our own society.

By 2020, I decided to uptick my sporadic social media status and attempt to parlay the "social media left", a group of people largely identifying as Bernie Sanders supporters, into a way to prove an entrepreunerial idea of mine tying video games to charity and support systems outside of the video game itself. The kids seemed to dig it, and I thought it was a great way to keep the energy that Sanders' primary campaign built up, but after he had stepped out of the primary.

What I wasn't prepared for was the duality of society that social media has introduced -- followers are nice, likes are special, and going viral is the goal -- but between all of that, if you can shit on someone else and feel like you're better than them, then social media will make that available to you.

I left the social media left in 2021 feeling that this toxicity was apolitical; it had nothing to do with politics, and it had eveyrthing to do with a pursuit of fame I coudln't understand.

Reader, I believe that toxicity and pursuit of fame that social media has come to define, one in which I was unaware of until 2020 in terms of degrees, has absolutely infilitrated the psychology of the Biden / Harris administration to the point where practical politics is impossible as they are spending time, tax dollars, and DNC assets in an attempt to become Netflix famous by smearing their political opponents -- even and especially when thyr'e private citizens, and then the Biden / Harris administration feels like they can use the law to smear them.

Pure fascism has come to America, and it wants to be televised.

*brief bullet poit, legal argument style perspective outlining the Biden / Harris' admin, perhaps at an appointee's level, likely fascination with crucifying me for political purposes and their motivations listed and summarized then explained a bit more below*

*bring up then Netflix CEO Reed Hasting's relatinship with the centrist Dems, including a connection to Obama via a podcast you were vaguely aware existed given his famous partner*

*Now bring up Obama's book, end with his weird mention of the woman who rejected him in Harvard and how he blames socialism and not lack of swerve*

*Now go back to Eloise bringing up her own relationship + Rachel Bird harrassment situation as a way to see if I'd behave sexistly; DNC projection*

*Come back to Russia -- they need you to not just be sexist, that's a "Bernie bro" stereotype they've built already, they need you to be a criminal, and they'd prefer you to be working with foreigners to at least justify CIA style activity on US social against a private citizen via a political party*

*Make a joke about Democrat era McCarthyism. McBidenism? McHarrism? McTandenism? I've been trying to figure this one out for weeks folks, it's been hard. It'll come, a mention should be fine for now.*

*A quick sentence that perhaps the Crypto industry would have had a better 2022, particularly in the second half, if the DNC hadn't of distracted them into this shit show. But be brief compared to the above as it hits sooner, hint towards base bank liquidity issues past crypto that are likel ythe Netflix/DNC's fault as well*

*End with an allusion to the failure to secure the right to abortion in early May and hint to the reader that since this shit show has never stopped, you ahve always felt the Biden Harris administration distracted themselves into chasing you like a criminal to crucify ala christ so the townspeople knew not to go against the doctrine of the times. I feel this way because largely because they would have just left me alone if they didn't feel I was to blame for their professional failures. DNC projection, again.*


Reader, I write this in 2023 facing criminal charges brought up in the context of me spending my late 2022 and early 2023 making a series of dropbox videos in the style of a "confessional" outlining these events. I did this largely as a way to clear my name should anyone try and smear it; had the parties I felt were harassing me simply left or provided evidence they were stopping their behaviors, I would have stopped making the videos, and if they can at some point, I could even disavow them. But until then, I'm pretty certain my current situation is not necessarily because of what happened at Vouch, but what's happening to this country: _partisan division over practical politics_. Over social media, no less.

Now, in 2023, I may be facing time or at least a life of always being labeled a criminal simply for trying to make a publicly accessible video recording of not my proof of anything in fact; but what remains a fiction until proven true: my story. All I know is that I was acting, and talking about acting, and acting while talking about acting - but on my own recording devices, not their's.

This has, clearly, and perhaps unfortunately, all been a big joke to me. Haven't you been reading? Not everyone finds me funny, sad but true.

Yes, the charges literally have to do with the video series. And yes, I'm writing this memoir literally as a way to keep my name clear before anything more can happen to me while confined or otherwise.

But that's 2023. Let's get back to early March 2022.
