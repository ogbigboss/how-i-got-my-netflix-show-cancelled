# Pt 1 Ch 9 - Back to my fifth week at Vouch 03/08/2022 and on

> "Why don't you just lie? That's what spies do, you know?" - Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

I've been playing guitar since about the age of 12.

When I was like, 6, my dad got a cheap acoustic and signed me up for a class where one poor adult soul attempted to, simultaneously, teach about 2 dozen other 6 year olds how to play "twinkle twinkle" on one string using a Mel Bay begginner's guitar book.

I'm pretty sure I went to that class one day, with my father and many other parents looking rather dubious in the back row. We kept the guitar.

One summer day I picked it up and figured out how to play the basic melody to "Louie Louie" on one string as a teenager. It was the opposite string the Mel Bay book started you on, the lowest string. I eventually picked up the Mel Bay book, and after learning "Twinkle Twinkle", I was happy that I wasn't 6 years old, not necessarily because of any reason to do with me - between the years 1992 and 1998, the internet had changed quite dramatically and I could find these coarsely written "tabs" to learn my favorite Blink 182 songs with.

I think I was 35 when I was watching Rick Beato on his YouTube channel interview a storied guitar player I'd learn about shortly after I picked up the guitar in earnest: famed New Yorker Joe Satriani.

Satriani regaled Beato with tales of learning the instrument, shared stories of their careers, and finally given they were both industry veterans in 2021, reflections on the industry. In particular, they noted that all you really need is one person who knows how to use a computer, and another person who really wants to be famous, and that's basically the formula these days; they offered in a somewhat ironic but mostly serious tone.

I remember Satriani saying something like this in particular:

> "So if you're a character, just go for it."

(nts: rewatch interview, its a really good one. Joe's got a great story about learning jazz theory I think from some character in Queens, plus the above quote I think is the very end of the interview, anyway)

...

Reader, again, had I known at the time what Razzlekhan meant, I'd of thought of a different plan.

However, as of early March 2022, my perspective was this: I'm under some kind of federal investigation that the boots on the ground are clearly not taking seriously, as well as those conducting the surveillance from behind the scenes. So whoever ordered this isn't necessarily in the immediate picture. I couldn't imagine them being that high "up the chain", and figure'd this was to try and impress someone within the DNC or something given the political framing that could be manipulated were I any kind of criminal, particularly a federal offending one.

Given the Biden Harris administration is one I voted for, I'd rather whomever wanted to impress them for political purposes look back in front of their bosses instead, while embarassing my bosses or whomever ordered this internally within Vouch, and all while keeping it entertaining for the troops, because, why not, I'm literally naming a human being "buttcheeks" in my head so I can remember them, it's not like I don't have some momentum here. 

I then thought about why they were having so much fun, and I could only assume it was _awkward_ -- the assumptions about me seemed, to me, to be rooted in rascism if anything. I'm just not sure why else the whistle would have been blown on me, at least in this way, and felt that someone acted in a bigoted way and no one wanted to address the obvious political hipocricy so, well, why not act stupid as fuckly?

Again reader, had I realized Razzlekhan was a thing that was to be on Netflix, and what that meant, and where the actual overlaps with mine and their lives were, I would've done _anything_ else.

So anyway, back in early March, I decided to entertain the troops as much as I could, and in turn I decided to act stupid as fuckly as I could.

And reader, had I realized that most of the "troops" were probably acting the way they were out of wanting to be Netflix famous, I probably would've just called a lawyer that minute.

But I didn't know what Razzlekhan was in early March, 2022.

...

*go back to getting back home from the walk, talk about the rest of that day, communicating to whomever was listening that you were well aware of what just took place and what it meant*

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, seeing if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention door knock in the morning from someone you assume was a fed and saw again in late July in the essex market knocking on my door and saying they got the wrong place, I at the time thought "the troops" were leaving and it was just me and my bosses aafter that -- that guy was probably working for Netflix in some capacity in retrospect*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
