> "Why don't you just lie? That's what spies do, you know?" - Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

I've been playing guitar since about the age of 12.

When I was like, 6, my dad got a cheap acoustic and signed me up for a class where one poor adult soul attempted to, simultaneously, teach about 2 dozen other 6 year olds how to play "twinkle twinkle" on one string using a Mel Bay begginner's guitar book.

I'm pretty sure I went to that class one day, with my father and many other parents looking rather dubious in the back row. We kept the guitar.

One summer day I picked it up and figured out how to play the basic melody to "Louie Louie" on one string as a teenager. It was the opposite string the Mel Bay book started you on, the lowest string. I eventually picked up the Mel Bay book, and after learning "Twinkle Twinkle", I was happy that I wasn't 6 years old, not necessarily because of any reason to do with me - between the years 1992 and 1998, the internet had changed quite dramatically and I could find these coarsely written "tabs" to learn my favorite Blink 182 songs with.

I think I was 35 when I was watching Rick Beato on his YouTube channel interview a storied guitar player I'd learn about shortly after I picked up the guitar in earnest: famed New Yorker Joe Satriani.

Satriani regaled Beato with tales of learning the instrument, shared stories of their careers, and finally given they were both industry veterans in 2021, reflections on the industry. In particular, they noted that all you really need is one person who knows how to use a computer, and another person who really wants to be famous, and that's basically the formula these days; they offered in a somewhat ironic but mostly serious tone.

I remember Satriani saying something like this in particular:

> "So if you're a character, just go for it."

(nts: rewatch interview, its a really good one. Joe's got a great story about learning jazz theory I think from some character in Queens, plus the above quote I think is the very end of the interview, anyway)

*go back to getting back home from the walk, talk about the rest of that day, communicating to whomever was listening that you were well aware of what just took place and what it meant*

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, seeing if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
