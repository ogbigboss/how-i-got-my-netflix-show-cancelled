# Pt 1 Ch 9 - Back to my fifth week at Vouch 03/08/2022 and on

> "Why don't you just lie? That's what spies do, you know?" - Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Reader, again, had I known at the time what Razzlekhan meant, I'd of thought of a different plan.

However, as of early March 2022, my perspective was this: I'm under some kind of federal investigation that the boots on the ground are clearly not taking seriously, as well as those conducting the surveillance from behind the scenes. So whoever ordered this isn't necessarily in the immediate picture. I couldn't imagine them being that high "up the chain", and figure'd this was to try and impress someone within the DNC or something given the political framing that could be manipulated were I any kind of criminal, particularly a federal offending one.

Given the Biden Harris administration is one I voted for, I'd rather whomever wanted to impress them for political purposes look bad in front of their bosses instead, while embarassing my bosses or whomever ordered this internally within Vouch, and all while keeping it entertaining for the troops, because, why not, I'm literally naming a human being "buttcheeks" in my head so I can remember them, it's not like I don't have some momentum here. 

I then thought about why they were having so much fun, and I could only assume it was _awkward_ -- the assumptions about me seemed, to me, to be rooted in rascism if anything. I'm just not sure why else the whistle would have been blown on me, at least in this way, and felt that someone acted in a bigoted way and no one wanted to address the obvious political hipocricy so, well, why not act stupid as fuckly?

Again reader, had I realized Razzlekhan was a thing that was to be on Netflix, and what that meant, and where the actual overlaps with mine and their lives were, I would've done _anything_ else.

So anyway, back in early March, I decided to entertain the troops as much as I could, and in turn I decided to act stupid as fuckly as I could.

And reader, had I realized that most of the "troops" were probably acting the way they were out of wanting to be Netflix famous, I probably would've just called a lawyer that minute.

But I didn't know what Razzlekhan was in early March, 2022.

...

I really wish I had been recording myself.

I really should have been at least taking some contemporaneous notes.

That said, I chose not to do these things on purpose at the time because my goal was to get this thing shut down _without_ leaving evidence so whomeever did this stupid ass shit would be handled internally in whater 2 or 3 or 4 letter department let this happen.

I really didn't think this or any White House administration, nor the country in general, needed to embarass itself considering how much effort I took to _not_ do anything illegal or extreme with regards to my "social media leftist" project. I knew that anything they took further would, in the end, embarass them and make them look fascist. I kind of figure'd they'd realize that on their own.

Like I said, I hadn't really thought I could be on a TV show -- that's what I was making fun of my bosses for acting like!

Anyway, when I got home from that walk, after realizing that not only was I followed, I was being surveilled and my movements were being planned against, AND they were for some reason having fun with it and telling each other things like "quick! run ahead of him and flex your ass funny ok, like you were a gay! Gary, I can say a gay, that's ok with you right?" over headset mics and earpieces.

Or so I presumed. It's funny I didn't think _more_ about the possibility of being on a TV show at the time. But I digress.

When I got back home I went to my window so I could look outside across the street and made sure my laptop was nearby as I chastised them.

Again, I can't remember _exactly_ what I said. But I made it clear that I thought the following about a group of people I would come to later, but perhaps then, often describe directly as "you fucks."

1. You fucks aren't one department, you're several, and some are private folks, meaning this isn't anything official
1. Some of you fucks are from around here, and some of you aren't, and some of you fucks are hackers, and some of you are johnny law types
1. Zero of you fucks are taking this seriously

I made fun of how dumb the situation was, mostly, as I recall, and at some point after telling everyone to go home, I got back to work.

I think I said one thing though, just to keep some hope alive in those dumb enough to believe that, given how much change the FBI could say I had in my bank accounts, I was some kind of super hacker.

> "Look, you want to know about me? I used to do some things, with some people, but that's gone now and so are many of them. You happy?"

At least that's the best I can remember. I don't think I really started _lying_ lying until the next day.

...

I've been playing guitar since about the age of 12.

When I was like, 6, my dad got a cheap acoustic and signed me up for a class where one poor adult soul attempted to, simultaneously, teach about 2 dozen other 6 year olds how to play "twinkle twinkle" on one string using a Mel Bay begginner's guitar book.

I'm pretty sure I went to that class one day, with my father and many other parents looking rather dubious in the back row. We kept the guitar.

One summer day I picked it up and figured out how to play the basic melody to "Louie Louie" on one string as a teenager. It was the opposite string the Mel Bay book started you on, the lowest string. I eventually picked up the Mel Bay book, and after learning "Twinkle Twinkle", I was happy that I wasn't 6 years old, not necessarily because of any reason to do with me - between the years 1992 and 1998, the internet had changed quite dramatically and I could find these coarsely written "tabs" to learn my favorite Blink 182 songs with.

I think I was 35 when I was watching Rick Beato on his YouTube channel interview a storied guitar player I'd learn about shortly after I picked up the guitar in earnest: famed guitar player __ (nts: look I'm 99% sure it's satriani and I missed it a second ago when I rewarched their interview, but it's definitely someone talking to Beato, I think it may be Tim Pierce, but it also could be Satch w/ someone else. I'll do the research before publishing).

The "famed guitar player" regaled Beato with tales of learning the instrument, shared stories of their careers, and finally given they were both industry veterans in 2021, reflections on the industry. In particular, they noted that all you really need is one person who knows how to use a computer, and another person who really wants to be famous, and that's basically the formula these days; they offered in a somewhat ironic but mostly serious tone.

I remember the "famed guitar player" saying something like this in particular:

> "So if you're a character, just go for it."

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, realizing there's no way the government would step this far without at least talking to my sister who has worked for their employ in some way twice though yes as a civilian, looking up Wallace and wondering more about him, deciding I might as well see if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to in order to lay down more breadcrumbs of inappropriate behavior to be exposed at a later time internally so I can go back to being a well paid normal computer programmer who occassionally talks through programming problems out loud*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention door knock in the morning from someone you assume was a fed and saw again in late July in the essex market knocking on my door and saying they got the wrong place, I at the time thought "the troops" were leaving and it was just me and my bosses aafter that -- that guy was probably working for Netflix in some capacity in retrospect*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
