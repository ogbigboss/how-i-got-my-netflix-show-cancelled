# Pt 1 Ch 9 - Back to my fifth week at Vouch 03/08/2022 and on

> "Why don't you just lie? That's what spies do, you know?" - Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Reader, again, had I known at the time what Razzlekhan meant, I'd of thought of a different plan.

However, as of early March 2022, my perspective was this: I'm under some kind of federal investigation that the boots on the ground are clearly not taking seriously, as well as those conducting the surveillance from behind the scenes. So whoever ordered this isn't necessarily in the immediate picture. I couldn't imagine them being that high "up the chain", and figure'd this was to try and impress someone within the DNC or something given the political framing that could be manipulated were I any kind of criminal, particularly a federal offending one.

Given the Biden Harris administration is one I voted for, I'd rather whomever wanted to impress them for political purposes look bad in front of their bosses instead, while embarassing my bosses or whomever ordered this internally within Vouch, and all while keeping it entertaining for the troops, because, why not, I'm literally naming a human being "buttcheeks" in my head so I can remember them, it's not like I don't have some momentum here. 

I then thought about why they were having so much fun, and I could only assume it was _awkward_ -- the assumptions about me seemed, to me, to be rooted in rascism if anything. I'm just not sure why else the whistle would have been blown on me, at least in this way, and felt that someone acted in a bigoted way and no one wanted to address the obvious political hipocricy so, well, why not act stupid as fuckly?

Again reader, had I realized Razzlekhan was a thing that was to be on Netflix, and what that meant, and where the actual overlaps with mine and their lives were, I would've done _anything_ else.

So anyway, back in early March, I decided to entertain the troops as much as I could, and in turn I decided to act stupid as fuckly as I could.

And reader, had I realized that most of the "troops" were probably acting the way they were out of wanting to be Netflix famous, I probably would've just called a lawyer that minute.

But I didn't know what Razzlekhan was in early March, 2022.

...

I really wish I had been recording myself.

I really should have been at least taking some contemporaneous notes.

That said, I chose not to do these things on purpose at the time because my goal was to get this thing shut down _without_ leaving evidence so whomeever did this stupid ass shit would be handled internally in whater 2 or 3 or 4 letter department let this happen.

I really didn't think this or any White House administration, nor the country in general, needed to embarass itself considering how much effort I took to _not_ do anything illegal or extreme with regards to my "social media leftist" project. I knew that anything they took further would, in the end, embarass them and make them look fascist. I kind of figure'd they'd realize that on their own.

Like I said, I hadn't really thought I could be on a TV show -- that's what I was making fun of my bosses for acting like!

Anyway, when I got home from that walk, after realizing that not only was I followed, I was being surveilled and my movements were being planned against, AND they were for some reason having fun with it and telling each other things like "quick! run ahead of him and flex your ass funny ok, like you were a gay! Gary, I can say a gay, that's ok with you right?" over headset mics and earpieces.

Or so I presumed. It's funny I didn't think _more_ about the possibility of being on a TV show at the time. But I digress.

When I got back home I went to my window so I could look outside across the street and made sure my laptop was nearby as I chastised them.

Again, I can't remember _exactly_ what I said. But I made it clear that I thought the following about a group of people I would come to later, but perhaps then, often describe directly as "you fucks."

1. You fucks aren't one department, you're several, and some are private folks, meaning this isn't anything official
1. Some of you fucks are from around here, and some of you aren't, and some of you fucks are hackers, and some of you are johnny law types
1. Zero of you fucks are taking this seriously

I made fun of how dumb the situation was, mostly, as I recall, and at some point after telling everyone to go home, I got back to work.

I think I said one thing though, just to keep some hope alive in those dumb enough to believe that, given how much change the FBI could say I had in my bank accounts, I was some kind of super hacker.

> "Look, you want to know about me? I used to do some things, with some people, but that's gone now and so are many of them. You happy?"

At least that's the best I can remember. I don't think I really started _lying_ lying until the later that day.

...

I've been playing guitar since about the age of 12.

When I was like, 6, my dad got a cheap acoustic and signed me up for a class where one poor adult soul attempted to, simultaneously, teach about 2 dozen other 6 year olds how to play "twinkle twinkle" on one string using a Mel Bay begginner's guitar book.

I'm pretty sure I went to that class one day, with my father and many other parents looking rather dubious in the back row. We kept the guitar.

One summer day I picked it up and figured out how to play the basic melody to "Louie Louie" on one string as a teenager. It was the opposite string the Mel Bay book started you on, the lowest string. I eventually picked up the Mel Bay book, and after learning "Twinkle Twinkle", I was happy that I wasn't 6 years old, not necessarily because of any reason to do with me - between the years 1992 and 1998, the internet had changed quite dramatically and I could find these coarsely written "tabs" to learn my favorite Blink 182 songs with.

I think I was 35 when I was watching Rick Beato on his YouTube channel interview a storied guitar player I'd learn about shortly after I picked up the guitar in earnest: famed guitar player __ (nts: look I'm 99% sure it's satriani and I missed it a second ago when I rewarched their interview, but it's definitely someone talking to Beato, I think it may be Tim Pierce, but it also could be Satch w/ someone else. I'll do the research before publishing).

The "famed guitar player" regaled Beato with tales of learning the instrument, shared stories of their careers, and finally given they were both industry veterans in 2021, reflections on the industry. In particular, they noted that all you really need is one person who knows how to use a computer, and another person who really wants to be famous, and that's basically the formula these days; they offered in a somewhat ironic but mostly serious tone.

I remember the "famed guitar player" saying something like this in particular:

> "So if you're a character, just go for it."

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

So I felt confident about more than a few things, but mostly two -- my bosses had some sort of audio surveillance software if not also video running on my laptop they gave me, and, I was under some sort of perhaps speculative, off the books, "not" investigation involving both private investigative and federal forces, due to what I assumed at the time were mostly miscommunications between my bosses and the federal government, and at some level a security firm contracted by Vouch, possibly.

Oh, I also felt confident it was something of a joke. I'm not sure if Quantico or Langley offer "buttcheek meanuever training", but I guessed that at the time my situation was the most harmless version of what many call a "black bag operation" on behalf of the intelligence services and law enforcement at a Federal level, with some number of private connections due to my employment.

So I figure'd, well, given that that's my audience -- "intelligence" types and maybe "cops" as well as "politicos," I just couldn't help but think of my favorite TV show of all time, which, you may have guessed, would be USA Networks' _Burn Notice_.

Michael Westen, the show's main character, is your typical absolute absurdist theater of a "spy" whom somehow has the skills of about several dozen people in an incredibly recognizable body that would absolutely have been gunned down by one cartel or some other organization somewhere in the first two seasons of a show, which, despite it's military, intelligence, and at times political allusions, would still be best described as, well, campy.

> CAMP: A sensibility that revels in artifice, stylization, theatricalization, irony, playfulness, and exaggeration rather than content, as Susan Sontag famously defined the term in her short essay, "Notes on 'Camp.'" According to Sontag, "Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticizedâ€”or at least apolitical"
>
> [Some Purdue link from a class on postmodernism](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/postmodernism/terms/camp.html)

I knew this was likely inspired at some level by internal Democrat partisanship more than anything, and I just didn't care for that, but I also knew _who_ my audience was - or so I thought.

Look, you ask me what _my_ favorite things about _Burn Notice_ would be? It would be the campy nature of the character's relationships, obviously the narration and it's 'field notes' style writing such to be broader than the context being spoken of, but mostly? The music. Hell yeah, give me that Miami ass soundtrack anytime.

I'm not sure the show couldn't be more apolitical given it's context of the main character being an "on again off again" CIA agent, in Miami of all places, somehow constantly dealing with ex European and often former Soviet agents in the late aughts, but it's not exactly the most political show either.

Again reader, I forgot _everything_ I said, and I'm guessing _someone_ recorded it, but, I think I was just trying to do what Jeffrey Donovan does as Michael Westen: obviously play a character. Often times the Michael Westen character "goes undercover" as spies do, and convinces some criminal cartel -- of which there are an alarming amount of in one city in Florida by the way, and none of them talk about the guy that looks like famed _Wrath of Man_ actor Jeffrey Donovan! -- to do something which typically incriminates them, or makes them run away and stop doing whatever it was they were doing at the episode's beginning.

But the point is, to my opinion at least, Jeffrey Donovan is being obvious as an actor - irl - that his character Michael Westen is acting. He's not being very convincing because he realizes his audience needs to at least have an avenue to understand he's "under cover", and Donovan does my favorite thing on the show.

I lied about the music.

My favorite thing about _Burn Notice_ is Jeffrey Donovan's weird characters that he uses when he goes "under cover" -- there's the crime guy from Bahston, the crime guy from the Redneck Riviera, the crime guy from New Yahk, the mines diamonds but murders the villagers first guy from Australia or maybe somewhere else idk, and many, many more, alongside the equally hilarious caricatures "tactically deployed" by the characters played by Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Coby Bell, Sharon Gless, and many more. They're all great. And yeah, I find them, well, hilarious.

Anyway, the character Michael Westen had numerous skills, but, the show most often relied on his skill of figuring out people and getting them to commit crimes that defame or incriminate them.

So I _think_, as I was really just kind of "riffing", I started playing what to me would be an obviously fake version of a Michael Westen, of some sorts, whom, is just a computer programmer now.

The downfall of camp can be in it's misinterpretation, of course. 

I knew _some_ people would get what I was doing -- maybe not referencing _Burn Notice_ itself, though, perhaps if they had the NSA research my faves for profiling. And I knew some people might... not. Repeating the cycle of the previous experiment where I try to embarass whomever doesn't get that I'm joking.

I don't remember _everything_ I said, but in early March 2022 I remember some shit like this:

> "You all fucked up and now your leadership in various levels both looks bad and is trying to deal with it with as much grace as possible. Let me make something clear: you acted maleovolently here, whether you like it or not, making me the Benevolent Actor. As the Benevolent Actor, chaos will always favor me. I'd reccomend you all find a way out of this situation as soon as possible."

Followed by some other shit like this:

> "Look, sorry Vouch, but you just don't impress me. I've seen it all - an organization like yours isn't any different from your average large criminal organization or even your average small terrorist cell out in the middle east. You don't need to worry about me now - you need to worry about 3 or 6 months from now. You'll start turning on each other and blaming each other. You may not separate or make a legal issue out of it, but your organization will splinter internally in social ways that could be exploited. You'd be better off thinking about your exit strategy here, particularly emotionally, so you all stay together."

Pretty sure 6 months later I'd be setup by the DNC KHive while in the audience of a Bruce Springsteen / Jann Wenner on-stage interview, but reader, I didn't take the bait -- you could say that a champ like me, baby, I was Born to Run, or perhaps, preferred to not gather some wack ass "how do you do fellow kids lets talk about supporting the FTC and call it a culture council" moss - but, I digress. 6 months later I had realized I was on some kind of Reality TV show at least.

Back to March 2022, I just thought my bosses tried playing with the government looked stupid for it - I kept saying shit inferring the above, but making it clear that I was "done" or "out".

I'm pretty sure I wasn't in meetings, I was just talking out loud to a laptop.

I made it pretty clear that if they just wanted to knock on my door and talk things through, I could do that. It was a joke I made several times over the course of the next few weeks. I think they found that one really funny.

During my month or so at Vouch, I was assigned two whole work items; they were both minor. Maybe I'd of had less time on my hands if I was being utilitized as a web developer and not bait for a Netflix television show.

I guess I underestimated my audience, in terms of stature amongst other things.

...

*talk about that evening, realizing there's no way the government would step this far without at least talking to my sister who has worked for their employ in some way twice though yes as a civilian, looking up Wallace and wondering more about him, deciding I might as well see if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to in order to lay down more breadcrumbs of inappropriate behavior to be exposed at a later time internally so I can go back to being a well paid normal computer programmer who occassionally talks through programming problems out loud*

As the evening came, none of the cars across the street showed any indication of moving, and in fact seemed to be going in and out every now and then.

I figure'd it was to pickup food, mostly.

I remember thinking to myself _well ok, this is dumb. There's no way the government would get themselves this involved without first talking to at least some of my relations, especially if any worked in the government... like my sister, for example, who was currently employed by the court system, as well as having a previous stint in the EOC._ And I sighed.

My sister and I have been estranged for around the last 5 years. I've had numerous difficult situations with my family in the past that are probably more than common to first generation immigrant families. Growing up, my sister would often be the one to offer perspectives to my parents to realize that things may be different here -- her being older, this is also very common.

As me and my sister grew older, particularly after she went to college at Brown University, I felt a type of animosity between the two of us. I believe she feels the parents were much harder on her, and that she was held back socially in ways I didn't have to deal with growing up, and as an adult resents me for it.

One time when I was like 19 and back home from college and she was 23 and after her first year of law school I think, the parents were away. I spent the night at a friend's house, and told her I wouldn't be back til tomorrow because we were drinking.

We had put an ounce of weed in a bottle of everclear and let it sit for a week. It seemed better to not drive home.

She warned that the parents wouldn't want that, and when they came home two days later, she tried to "rat me out" and see if htey'd yell at me.

They were confused and didn't care. I yelled at her a bit for that, and I regret some of the words I said.

If, some 15 years later, my sister had an opportunity to say to the parents that I was under a Federal Investigation and was actually a criminal this whole time well... she might, it really wouldn't suprise me.

Idk. We've been estranged for well, not shit as stupid as that, but certainly shit like that. I'd prefer her help me out when it comes to my parents a bit more, and I think she'd prefer to... play out some weird sibling melodrama.

Awkward, I know. In retrospect this must have been very easy for certain actors to exploit.

The thought made me somewhat depressed.

...

Later that evening, I decided to go over the scenario a bit more, and somehow came back to the John Wallace message in the DEI chat. Days later he still hadn't edited it.

I wondered -- what if Rajat was being truthful and it was John? Would my theory about him being the guy who hit on Rachel, a 40 year old entry into tech, work out in any other ways?

I remember he recently moved from Wisconsin to Chicago. I looked up the neighborhoods - in WI, he lived in the suburbs. In Chicago, well, it's Chicago. It's a city.

Who moves from the suburbs to a city in their late 40s and is a corporate executive type?

A divorced dork ass loser corporate executive type.

I checked public divorce records in Wisconsin and found information that would match up to Wallace, and indicating that the divorce proceedings must have taken place as he was beginning to talk to Sam Hodges and Travis Hedge about joining Vouch.

I'm guessing he divorced his wife on purpose before joining Vouch to make sure she wouldn't receive his life changing "big tech" money.

Historically, and to this day due to a lack of equal pay laws, it's to some degree true that a woman's best bet in terms of financial security is their marriage.

I think there was something to this mix that really bothered me, considering my sister was a DEI officer and all.

...

_Jesus fucking christ. My sister wants to prove to the parents I'm a criminal and she lied to some feds about me in some stupid ass way and that's a good enough explanation as to why I'm here - her word would mean more than mine given her employment history._

_I want to kill myself._

It was just a thought.

I've had a lot of therapy in my life - a lifetime where I've had to deal with suicidal thoughts.

You really don't want to let them spiral. You need to deal with it in the moment, as you're triggered.

My CBT based technique for such thoughts is structured in 4 steps:

1. Identify what triggered you
1. Summarize it into one thought, emotionally
1. Summarize it into one or two words, emotionally
1. Try and turn it around or see it another way

It may not be what everyone does, but whenever I feel emotionally triggered, I do the above.

CBT comes from a branch of therapy called evolutionary psychology. The idea is that you can "evolve" your brain, or grow emotionally, given repetitive exercises.

I've been doing the above 4 step process for over a decade now.

It really helps, so I did it for this case.

*CBT steps for the above*

*Deciding that without therapy, I would be suicidal, and I should leave a trail of that to see if they'd react, becaues then there'd be a record of whomeever is doing this stupid ass shit in taking advantage of my mental health instead of fucking off and letting me be*

*Take the walk of death, make analogy between 1-10 scale for suicidality and a 0-100% chance of them killing you IRL, and putting it at 15%*

...

*mention door knock in the morning from someone you assume was a fed and saw again in late July in the essex market knocking on my door and saying they got the wrong place, I at the time thought "the troops" were leaving and it was just me and my bosses aafter that -- that guy was probably working for Netflix in some capacity in retrospect*

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
