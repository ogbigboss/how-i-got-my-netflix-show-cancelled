# Pt I Chapter 10 - A brief explanation on why I'm such, at least at this point of my life, a loser

> Michael Narrating: Sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are... to pretending you are who you say you are.

*explain to your dear reader why you weren't really uhhh socializing at all in any normative ways and how that may have looked given the context*

*tell them you're a loser and you knew it but it was fine since you are in between definitive states in your adult life and you're not as hung up about it as others may perceive which, normally, isn't my problem*

*imply that in the context of people spying on you you didn't care because you're in your mid thirties and don't really care what people who would spend that much money and time ot spy on you would think in the first place*

*finish with why you didn't care because you realized how, historically, people like you are treated after trying things like the video game project, and that, in feudal times, you'd be beheaded, and in modern times, you figure'd a federal investigation to clear your (my) name early on in my life before I get a business going may actually be the best thing for me*
