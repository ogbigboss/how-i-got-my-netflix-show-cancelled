# Pt I Chapter 10 - A brief explanation on why I'm such, at least at this point of my life, a loser

> Michael Narrating: Sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are... to pretending you are who you say you are.

*tell them you're a loser and you knew it but it was fine since you are in between definitive states in your adult life and you're not as hung up about it as others may perceive which, normally, isn't my problem*

In my mid thirties, I definitely portray a certain male stereotype - I'm not dating, have really only had one actual relationship, and have a lot of hobbies that many adolescents have - I used to feel well, ashamed of such things, but mostly with therapy I've grown to not care, though, such things were never why I went to therapy. That was more the whole "I have a successful career but why do I still feel awful" question I started asking 2 years into my career of being a web developer.

In terms of dating I was an early bloomer. I think 9/11, which took place after said blooming, was a bit weird for me to contextualize after starting to contextualize things like dating, and I shut down a bit. Later in life, I wondered if that experience stuck with me, but as we got closer to a post "me too" era in society, I began to have suspicions that felt far more suitable after late 2017.

_What if I just didn't want sex as much as most people and preferred to do other things, at least for the time being?_

This was an awkward thought I left unsaid, even in therapy. But after reading all of the accounts from not cis gendered men (mostly) after late 2017 and into 2018 as "me too" proliferated through the media, I began to feel that I was probably more correct there than the rest of society.

So if, by society's standards, I was a loser, after late 2017, I wasn't really all that mad about it.

I did, however, detach from a group of mostly male friends I associated to from and after high school. I mostly kept close so my parents could feel like I had a social connection to people that didn't need to concern them, and in realizing that was a dumb reason to stay connected to people I didn't really feel personally connected to, I moved away from hanging out from my mostly male high school friends.

There's one slightly complicated part to this, albeit yes, I am a computer programmer whose hobbies are playing guitar, video games, and programming video games and guitar plugins. I'll just say it.

I'm pretty good looking.

Especially on a webcam.

Like I said, had I known I was being scouted for a Netflix true crime series, I would have done everything differently. But I think consent is important in a lot of cases, especially for when you're not doing crimes and you're being scouted for a Netflix true crime series. That said I grew up in a household where for the most part even my parents had an innate respect for privacy. I wonder what the founding fathers would say about our world today with regards to the privacy of our homes being invaded by a series of contraptions that are probably all Ben Franklin's fault to begin with. But I digress.

_Is this thing on?_

After moving away from my friends in 2018, I began to slowly spend my time chasing a dream I've always had of being a video game developer that could support themselves through their own game. Being a computer programmer gave me a pretty good advantage. I began to Twitch stream myself developing and made something of normative social conenctions to get me through that time. I'd like to think at worst I wasted my time, at best I helped some people get into or through programming if they were interested and less experienced than I, and to an extreme, six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon kind of way, influenced a major motion picture, but that last one is really unlikely, compared to the rest of this book.

I was in my mid thirties. I was in debt but I had a career that could help me get out of it and keep a decent standard of living which is very hard to achieve in 2022. I was grateful for the life I had, if someone wanted to call me a loser they could go ahead and do so.

I was really happy to be honest.

I just didn't want to share that happiness with anyone at the time; not through dating, and *certainly* not through audio surveillance while working from home.

I really, really, really miss my life before all this started reader. I wouldn't care what anyone thought of it and I still don't.

...

That said, I will submit, that after making a game project along a political side that has historically been shut down by police states as a precursur to some other type of fascism settling in via a violent coup of some sort like the one that almost took place in America in 2020, being a guy who spends all their time alone and may be suspected of being a spy might seem... suspicious.

But I didn't care. I know how people like me, do gooders, are historically treated.

I was trying to raise money for those affected by COVID 19 - medically or financially, fwiw - and yes, an issue I personally care about, climate change, while trying to make a platform that could fund all issues, even ones I didn't care for, at the option of the user, via a farming video game.

Yes, I knew I was writing a twisted _Scooby Doo_ novel, but reader, I also know this: I'm not exactly a solid Christ figure.

I curse a lot. A lot. I talk a lot of shit. A lot. I really, really, really just don't care what you think about me. And I want you to call it out, which shows deep down inside I do care a little bit, but if you give me even a slight reason for me to not care, I'm gonna make it so clear. SO clear.

That's really petty. Jesus would never.

And yet, I knew because this may give the wrong impression to the now royal court of the KHive DNC, I was probably being treated as some kind of bait for someone to get up their own professional food chain. And if I was a loser, the KHive types, brains infected by social media sadism, would only enjoy making fun of me for it.

A few thoughts came to mind:

_So if these people put me under audio surveillance for political purposes, and are making fun of me while doing so, someone else is watching them right now and they're representing government intelligence services that are certainly not all KHive loyalists._

As well as:

_It's probably not a bad idea for someone like me to go through a purely political investigation internally in the government, have it shut down as it's obviously a witch hunt at worst or a misunderstanding at best, such that my future activities aren't met with such discprencies of professionality?_

And finally:

_Welp, I guess I'm gonna spend the rest of my life under some light tabs or surveillance. Can't be helped. Good thing marijuana's legal; I'm just not sure of a crime that I really need to commit. I'd really have to think hard about that one._

Again reader, my project was pretty explicit in the whole "not a crime" thing -- just a game that gave some of it's money to other groups.

Pretty sure the customer would get the tax deduction, not us, for whatever it's worth. I never got around to hiring a tax profesional to make sure though, because, well, I'm broke.

But I felt and still feel hopeful I can ressurect my project in time, and I knew it would at some point be looked into from the point of view of political machinations and not helping society at large, so I figure'd the earlier would be the better, the more internal it is, even better.

That said, in the worst case scenarios, I'd have the receipts.

...

Later that week, after one day I took off, I looked outside and across the street. I was talking openly, if they heard me it would have had to have been through another device as my laptop was in the other room, or through some sort of device pointed at my window picking up on the vibrations of what I was saying. Or maybe they could read lips.

I basically thanked everyone across the street for not being weird. I then half jokingly asked, given that several seemed to be sitting in or getting in and out of their cars at the time, a polite request:

> "You know, it'd be great if, just so I knew I wasn't crazy the guy in the car over there could blink their lights."

The headlights blinked.

> "Oh. Wow. Ok."

After some time, I thought and then offered this:

> "Well... ok... that could be a coincidence. Could it maybe pull out and leave?"

After a moment, the car did just that.

One thing I had thought was a bit weird was that one car seemed to stand out. That was weird to me because I wasn't sure why anyone in this situation would buy a vehicle which would. I was pretty sure it was a Tesla. I remember saying this when I saw someone get in with the lights on shortly after that.

> "Wow, you know I've always wanted to drive one of those electric cars. I hear the pickup is immediate, must be nice."

As though to demonstrate that, yes, they can hear me, and yes, the car can pickup quickly, just as I finish the sentence, and before I could take my next breath, the Tesla jumps out and leaves the parking lot.

I remember thinking _Well someone really likes their new rental. Though its' weird; what kind of a fed would rent a Tesla? It's literally a bright white car._

And in the furthest corner of my mind:

_Well... that guy really likes social media too... and his ex wife seemed to get into politics in a way that could lump him in with a certain recent late 2020 author in feeling sexually frustrated and blaming it on political ideology as opposed to moving on in life... it would be crazy... but the game project was largely a twitter thing, comms wise... fuck... I really hope it isn't Elon._

And then:

_I'm weird enough for one life. I don't need a guy who may be as or more weird than me to be involved in it. I have enough chaos as it is._

I kept it in my head, just in case I was correct. All of what just happened could be a series of coincidences, after all.

The Tesla sedan in question is extremely popular and sold very well throughout the early 2020's.

I really didn't want this situation getting weirder, I swear.

But at the time I felt like the "investigation" was over and the "investigators" were making it as clear to me as possible that it was never a serious thing to begin with, and that maybe yeah a Tesla would be cool to drive.

...

Later that weekend I tried getting my mind off of the whole thing, but I just couldn't.

Two things bothered me: many of my coworkers felt to me, to have an excited energy most familiar to me as gossip.

I, in my middle age, ignore the energy as soon as I see it. 

If it really needs to be known, then it can't be avoided.

Gossip can be avoided.

However, in this situation, not only was it something I was paging for, I was also looking for that certain flavor of gossip:

_People are talking about you behind your back._

It usually comes across as a light teasing that can't be spoken on - yet, or perhaps ever. It makes the other person feel better, in an almost magical way, in your presence. Every question is loaded such that if you never answer in a way that reveals your suspicions - if you never cross the line - then it offers the other person pleasure, of a social variety: a feeling of dominance.

Others reveal this by feeling nervous, and guilty. They don't want to be involved.

And, there is the gradient in between. Sometimes you have to chuckle to get by at something that makes you uncomfortable because the person doing the something is more powerful than you are, or at least, has been at the firm, organization, or tribe for longer.

My mind flashed in particular to the woman who kept bringing up the Sandanistas in a women's history month meeting that I believe was focused on the Stonewall riots. She had appeared as though she dyed her recently.

I thought it looked nice, for whatever it's worth. Her curls seemed natural and fluffy and light; she likely was just hiding some gray.

I remember thinking, however, this funny and retrospectively hiarious thought:

_Did she dye her hair because she knew someone would be watching her ask me this and want to impress them?_

Reader: How did I NOT know I was on a reality TV show?

Sigh. It's probably because I wanted a normal job so I could pay my debts and live a life under light surveillance that goes nowhere because I'm trying to positively but creatively contribute to society. That's what I wanted at least.

Alas.

...

Reader, you may be wondering: what work did you do while at Vouch?

Well, for a month, not much of anything. Eloise gave me the excuse of the company shifting, and some documents to look over, and the usual statements of "hang in there."

It's fine, that's normal really.

But I was given two light tasks I completed. One was a bit peculiar - it included a bug where a video was uploaded to show an example of the misbehavior.

I couldn't repeat the misbehavior in my browsers, trying many.

I honestly felt like the video had been doctored. I imagined they wanted me to try and look at the frame where the "bug" was -- it was a distorted set of pixels -- and there would have been some kind of watermark or some message in it.

I mean, I don't know. I didn't do any of that stuff.

Instead, I just responded on the ticket that I couldn't replicate the behavior, and asked the person who brought it up to see if they could do it again. Sometimes hiccups happen and if you can't replicate a bug - meaning you can't reliably cause it to happen consistently, and especially if it only happened once - it's usually skipped.

I may be overanalyzing it.

If I don't have much to do, I tend to overanalyze what little I have to do.

It's usually not that bad of a thing as a programmer, but, I wasn't a programmer.

I was being framed as a Reality TV star.

I just didn't know that at the time -- all I knew is somehow it seemed like my bosses dipshittedly used their connections to put me under a bogus investigation for no reason and I've waited 2 whole days and most of the weekend and gotten no semblance of a response. I think this warrants at least a notice.

Particularly if your employees, my coworkers, are gossipping about me as a result.

Sometimes, in my head, I see the meme of the cartoon _Arthur_, the one with the two frames, and the hands.

Sometimes, I just see the hands.

I returned to my CBT exercise quite a bit that weekend, and it calmed me down, but only so much.

I wanted answers.
