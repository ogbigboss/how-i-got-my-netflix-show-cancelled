# Pt I Chapter 10 - A brief explanation on why I'm such, at least at this point of my life, a loser

> Michael Narrating: Sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are... to pretending you are who you say you are.

*explain to your dear reader why you weren't really uhhh socializing at all in any normative ways and how that may have looked given the context*

*tell them you're a loser and you knew it but it was fine since you are in between definitive states in your adult life and you're not as hung up about it as others may perceive which, normally, isn't my problem*

*imply that in the context of people spying on you you didn't care because you're in your mid thirties and don't really care what people who would spend that much money and time ot spy on you would think in the first place*

*finish with why you didn't care because you realized how, historically, people like you are treated after trying things like the video game project, and that, in feudal times, you'd be beheaded, and in modern times, you figure'd a federal investigation to clear your (my) name early on in my life before I get a business going may actually be the best thing for me*

...

*talk about the light show across the street - mention the tesla - but take it as another signal that the gov't stuff was over and I was jsut left with my company, which I felt was fucked up and bad enough allowed me to focus on the company and I, mentally speaking at the time*

*get back to the weekend and reflect on the meeting where the guy with the dog seemed, well, excited about the whole thing, and talk about how you were concerned Vouch was treating this interanlly as a matter of gossip. Reflect on the Sandanista-baiter and how they both likely dyed their hair recently AND seemed very, well, excited, and talk about how at the time you read it as gossip. "reader, had I known about Razzlekhan or gave a fuck about reality tv or true crime etc etc"*

*to re-introduce Vouch, given that the next chapter is quitting the company, make a brief reflection on the work you were assigned while there -- two tasks, one seeming suspicious as though they wanted to know something about image bullshit -- but underline that over a month period you received little to no direction or direct work orders, pointing to at best internal disorganization and at worst internal disorganization due to a Netflix show*
