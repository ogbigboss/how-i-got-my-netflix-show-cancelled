# Pt I Chapter 10 - A brief explanation on why I'm such, at least at this point of my life, a loser

> Michael Narrating: Sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are... to pretending you are who you say you are.

*tell them you're a loser and you knew it but it was fine since you are in between definitive states in your adult life and you're not as hung up about it as others may perceive which, normally, isn't my problem*

In my mid thirties, I definitely portray a certain male stereotype - I'm not dating, have really only had one actual relationship, and have a lot of hobbies that many adolescents have - I used to feel well, ashamed of such things, but mostly with therapy I've grown to not care, though, such things were never why I went to therapy. That was more the whole "I have a successful career but why do I still feel awful" question I started asking 2 years into my career of being a web developer.

In terms of dating I was an early bloomer. I think 9/11, which took place after said blooming, was a bit weird for me to contextualize after starting to contextualize things like dating, and I shut down a bit. Later in life, I wondered if that experience stuck with me, but as we got closer to a post "me too" era in society, I began to have suspicions that felt far more suitable after late 2017.

_What if I just didn't want sex as much as most people and preferred to do other things, at least for the time being?_

This was an awkward thought I left unsaid, even in therapy. But after reading all of the accounts from not cis gendered men (mostly) after late 2017 and into 2018 as "me too" proliferated through the media, I began to feel that I was probably more correct there than the rest of society.

So if, by society's standards, I was a loser, after late 2017, I wasn't really all that mad about it.

I did, however, detach from a group of mostly male friends I associated to from and after high school. I mostly kept close so my parents could feel like I had a social connection to people that didn't need to concern them, and in realizing that was a dumb reason to stay connected to people I didn't really feel personally connected to, I moved away from hanging out from my mostly male high school friends.

There's one slightly complicated part to this, albeit yes, I am a computer programmer whose hobbies are playing guitar, video games, and programming video games and guitar plugins. I'll just say it.

I'm pretty good looking.

Especially on a webcam.

Like I said, had I known I was being scouted for a Netflix true crime series, I would have done everything differently. But I think consent is important in a lot of cases, especially for when you're not doing crimes and you're being scouted for a Netflix true crime series. That said I grew up in a household where for the most part even my parents had an innate respect for privacy. I wonder what the founding fathers would say about our world today with regards to the privacy of our homes being invaded by a series of contraptions that are probably all Ben Franklin's fault to begin with. But I digress.

_Is this thing on?_

After moving away from my friends in 2018, I began to slowly spend my time chasing a dream I've always had of being a video game developer that could support themselves through their own game. Being a computer programmer gave me a pretty good advantage. I began to Twitch stream myself developing and made something of normative social conenctions to get me through that time. I'd like to think at worst I wasted my time, at best I helped some people get into or through programming if they were interested and less experienced than I, and to an extreme, six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon kind of way, influenced a major motion picture, but that last one is really unlikely, compared to the rest of this book.

I was in my mid thirties. I was in debt but I had a career that could help me get out of it and keep a decent standard of living which is very hard to achieve in 2022. I was grateful for the life I had, if someone wanted to call me a loser they could go ahead and do so.

I was really happy to be honest.

I just didn't want to share that happiness with anyone at the time; not through dating, and *certainly* not through audio surveillance while working from home.

I really, really, really miss my life before all this started reader. I wouldn't care what anyone thought of it and I still don't.

...

That said, I will submit, that after making a game project along a political side that has historically been shut down by police states as a precursur to some other type of fascism settling in via a violent coup of some sort like the one that almost took place in America in 2020, being a guy who spends all their time alone and may be suspected of being a spy might seem... suspicious.

But I didn't care. I know how people like me, do gooders, are historically treated.

I was trying to raise money for those affected by COVID 19 - medically or financially, fwiw - and yes, an issue I personally care about, climate change, while trying to make a platform that could fund all issues, even ones I didn't care for, at the option of the user, via a farming video game.

Yes, I knew I was writing a twisted _Scooby Doo_ novel, but reader, I also know this: I'm not exactly a solid Christ figure.

I curse a lot. A lot. I talk a lot of shit. A lot. I really, really, really just don't care what you think about me. And I want you to call it out, which shows deep down inside I do care a little bit, but if you give me even a slight reason for me to not care, I'm gonna make it so clear. SO clear.

That's really petty. Jesus would never.

And yet, I knew because this may give the wrong impression to the now royal court of the KHive DNC, I was probably being treated as some kind of bait for someone to get up their own professional food chain. And if I was a loser, the KHive types, brains infected by social media sadism, would only enjoy making fun of me for it.

A few thoughts came to mind:

_So if these people put me under audio surveillance for political purposes, and are making fun of me while doing so, someone else is watching them right now and they're representing government intelligence services that are certainly not all KHive loyalists._

As well as:

_It's probably not a bad idea for someone like me to go through a purely political investigation internally in the government, have it shut down as it's obviously a witch hunt at worst or a misunderstanding at best, such that my future activities aren't met with such discprencies of professionality?_

And finally:

_Welp, I guess I'm gonna spend the rest of my life under some light tabs or surveillance. Can't be helped. Good thing marijuana's legal; I'm just not sure of a crime that I really need to commit. I'd really have to think hard about that one._

Again reader, my project was pretty explicit in the whole "not a crime" thing -- just a game that gave some of it's money to other groups.

Pretty sure the customer would get the tax deduction, not us, for whatever it's worth. I never got around to hiring a tax profesional to make sure though, because, well, I'm broke.

But I felt and still feel hopeful I can ressurect my project in time, and I knew it would at some point be looked into from the point of view of political machinations and not helping society at large, so I figure'd the earlier would be the better, the more internal it is, even better.

That said, in the worst case scenarios, I'd have the receipts.

...

*talk about the light show across the street - mention the tesla - but take it as another signal that the gov't stuff was over and I was jsut left with my company, which I felt was fucked up and bad enough allowed me to focus on the company and I, mentally speaking at the time*

*get back to the weekend and reflect on the meeting where the guy with the dog seemed, well, excited about the whole thing, and talk about how you were concerned Vouch was treating this interanlly as a matter of gossip. Reflect on the Sandanista-baiter and how they both likely dyed their hair recently AND seemed very, well, excited, and talk about how at the time you read it as gossip. "reader, had I known about Razzlekhan or gave a fuck about reality tv or true crime etc etc"*

*to re-introduce Vouch, given that the next chapter is quitting the company, make a brief reflection on the work you were assigned while there -- two tasks, one seeming suspicious as though they wanted to know something about image bullshit -- but underline that over a month period you received little to no direction or direct work orders, pointing to at best internal disorganization and at worst internal disorganization due to a Netflix show*
