I wanted a direct confrontation about this, which I was pretty sure something they didn't want, but I realized that if I brought it up and they reacted more strongly than the situation warranted, it was probably the best answer I'd get as to whether or not they fooled their way into incriminating the federal government.

Also, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

Alas, I never got a direct confrontation from my bosses.

...

#### Sunday, 3/13/2022

I tried not responding, but I believe I cracked on Sunday of that week.

I also thought that waving a flag early may help someone on Vouch's side -- or whomever, really -- react more quickly.

I was through being coy; I would have told them up front what was a lie and what wasn't, and we could have moved on from there. They could have fired me. I would've preferred they just had done so; it would've sent the same message they sent anyway when they later told me my machine was hacked for sending the messages I knew I sent.

Vouch didn't care what my life experience was like, they stopped having empathy for me awhile ago if they ever did in the first place.

I think I kept remembering the CEO saying the company motto with regards to how they treat their employees with "the golden rule" -- treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated -- all after I was pretty sure I was under audio surveillance, had law authorities involved to some extent, and on top of all that, had my boss asking questions like I was in the 1940's facing a McCarthyist inquisition; not like I was in the 2020's at a company espousing DEI of all things.

That said, though I was a brown man, my makeshift McCarthyist middle manager was a LGBTQ woman, so I guess things have gotten more diverse.

...

Based on their cadences, I was suspicious of one of my other coworkers being told something gossipy, though either not of alarm, or, they simply weren't alarmed.

Or, of course, they knew nothing, or nothing was happening.

Either way they seemed like a person who, if the above were true, would respond near immediately, and I had seen them pop in on the weekend often.

This person, not my boss or the CEO, weren't high up the food chain, but if they didn't respond, I would take that as a pretty strong indicator that they knew something and couldn't - most normal people would respond with concern to the below, I'd assume:

> "Hey, I know this is weird, but I feel like there may be a company rumour that started about me being a 'hacker' or 'scammer' of some kind. I think it may have had to do with some oddities and miscommunications when joining with regards to the background check and greater onboarding process. Would you mind telling me if I'm totally off here?"

Reader, they of course did not respond. It was the weekend but it was just an opening test. No, they didn't respond the next Monday.

I messaged my manager something a bit more direct the next day.

#### Monday, 3/14/2022

Reader, I could have been nicer about the whole thing.

But from the start I wanted to set a precedent - whomever did this shouldn't have and shouldn't, ever again, not to me or anyone else.

It took me a few days after last week's incidents to realize that if I don't hear from the company leadership, they oughta hear from me, because otherwise they probably wouldn't want to bring it up.

Being quiet about something like this is not the precedent I wanted to set.

I was hoping Vouch would at least understand that and have thought of an excuse for this "worst case scenario" - I caught them pointing the finger at me to the feds and they were wrong, surely people with their resumes would have done basic worst case scenario planning for something like this? Wouldn't the Government?

However, as to my urgency, I also did not want to spend years of my life working alongside people whom were gossipping about me being a criminal at the very start of our working relationships.

Even if things did work out I wanted my name cleared by everyone who heard about this nonsense, I deserved at least that from a company supporting the idea of "DEI" of all things.

Famed Israel-American psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnman spent much of their careers researching a concept called _anchoring_. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29#:~:text=Kahneman%20suggests%20that%20anchoring%20occurs,or%20low%20before%20their%20prediction)

> Kahneman and Tversky showed that people's judgements could be skewed either higher or lower when presented with random numbers either high or low before their prediction.

So, if you told someone the price of something was much higher than the cost it took to manufacture, and you were able to get them to agree to the higher price without the knowledge of the latter, you can see that "Anchoring" is something used quite often to control prices by psychosocial control such as marketing.

While Kahneman and Tversky's research in the mid 20th century was with regards to economic behavior, the topic of anchoring has since spread to be known as a generic cognitive bias equally at play for gender and race issues, and particularly in the workplace and academia.

From the US National Library of Medicine, [Race, Ethnicity, and Culture in the Medical Record: Implicit Bias or Patient Advocacy?
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685755/)

> Anchoring bias: when an initial piece of information (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis, age, race, ethnicity) is used to make subsequent judgments and interpretations of behavior, leading one to respond more favorably to verbal and non-verbal information that reinforces initial beliefs. For example, a patient who initially has been given a diagnosis of malingering may be subject to negative interpretations of behaviors, and other clinicians involved in the patientâ€™s care may anchor onto verbal and non-verbal information that confirms the initial belief that the patient is exaggerating or feigning symptoms for secondary gain.

My mind leapt to the fantastical part of my head that thinks of the worst case scenario - just in case:

_You know, if the Biden / Harris admin was involved somehow, I'm going to guess they are hip to how important it would be to set a precedent here before an entire industry anchors themselves to the concept of predatory audio surveillance for minority employees. They're the Democrats!_

But it was just a thought.

...

Monday morning, somewhere around 9 AM and before they would normally wake up as they lived in Michigan, messaged my immediate boss something like the below:

> Hey Eloise, this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling like there is at least a rumour being spread about me that I may be some sort of hacker, and at most I even might be under some sort of "investigation" as a result. I think the rumour started because of miscommunications over audio surveillance, possibly while I was watching my favorite show in the background, _Burn Notice_, about a spy.

Eloise responded within the hour, with some concern and saying they would ask about it up the chain, but, with a slight cadence that did not feel like the way they would write sentences.

It was just a hunch, but I had a feeling someone else was typing for Eloise. I didn't expect much of a response.

Maybe I should have waited longer. I certainly could have. I'm not sure it would have changed much.

I knew the C levels were on PST time for the most part, save for John Wallace.

At around 10:30 AM I believe, I sent a message to the CIO John Wallace and the CEO Sam Hodges, copy pasting what I told Eloise, but adding one extra line:

> And personally, if I was "put under an investigation" of some sort, and for some reason anyone was still suspicious of me for being something I'm not, I'd prefer they show up to my door so I can talk with my fists.

I mostly remember the part about the fists, I couldn't resist. I knew these people wanted to at least get away with pushing me around, otherwise they wouldn't of ever read as excited.

Otherwise they would've just asked me to stop fucking around. They had some opportunity, and no, I didn't realize I was on a Reality TV show at the time, and no, I'm not sure I care in retrospect.

Also, at the time, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

_What kind of fascism is this?_

I never got a response, and somwhere around noon, my access to Slack, the company's chat, and Google apps, the company's other main comms tool, were cut and I was signed out of everything.

I got a phone call from someone in HR.

...

I remember mostly being pissed off but realizing that that wasn't a way to act in this situation if they were gonna handle it this way.

My improv partners did NOT want to give me a single conversation where I would have the moral highground due to their actions against me. Fine, typical, but from the DEI Democrats? Nope. I wasn't going to let them off for this one, nope nope nope.

I sighed, and realized feigning fear to the best extent I could might make some sense, but I just don't think I had the motivation for it.

The HR person told me that the "company thinks I've been hacked" and that "strange messages were sent to Sam and John" which couldn't of been me.

They knew me so well, after all.

I took it all in like it was scenery, and responded to it as plainly as one could a beautiful landscape rolling by on a night train headed north by north west, which is to say, I didn't disagree with it, but I didn't think I was seeing the whole picture.

I told them that was interesting, and they told me something else - that they had contacted my emergency contacts.

_Why in the world would they contact my parents in this situation?_

Sure we were estranged, but I still have to put down _someone's_ number when I start jobs with insurance plans.

I hadn't really thought of bringing my family into the situation, to be honest. I had wondered about my sister, given her potential conenction to the CEO's college.

I believe at that point I tried explaining to the HR person what happened. They were a young African American woman who had earlier led the meeting on the Stonewall riots -- I thought they might like to know my side in brief, which I told them in a hurried and slightly fearful manner, that I think this had more to do with miscommunications over audio surveillance. I told her I think government workers were following me in the streets as a result.

I also told her that none of this was her fault; and that no matter what happens she should never blame herself. She seemed to appreciate that.

I knew my bosses were listening; I'm not an idiot.

I tried leaving anyone listening, but most plausibly the HR person, the feeling that I was afraid more than anything, and confused.

I was angry more than anything, along with annoyed:

_I have to call my parents now?_

...

As of that time, March 2022, me and the 'rents didn't talk regularly much. I asked them for a bit of financial support during Covid and they were happy to oblige, though not terribly happy to hear from me either. Other than that we've been "off again and on again" for more than a decade, with around maybe 3 years regularly speaking here and there.

My parents aren't very thrilled that I don't have a college degree: I ought to, by now, have at least two of them, at my age. It's a bit... unseemly. I think they're more angry about that than anything, and I don't have much intent to get one given my career as a web developer.

I haven't depended on them financially for over a decade now, and I'm proud of that given that I'm both a college dropout and the economy I've been employed in -- 2007 to 2022 -- has been more competitive than previous ones for folks of my generation. Most people I know in the city need their parents, at least more than I do. 

What if the reason I could live without their financial need AND do it without a college degree was because I was also some sort of criminal?

I'd like to have an emotionally steady relationship with my parents one day, but until then, I'm proud to have spent nearly 15 years not depending on them financially, with or without a college degree.

That all changed a few months later, when I realized that since at least March 2022, my parents had to be convinced by someone within the Federal Government that I may be a criminal, and may have convinced them right back that maybe, they were right.

Did you know that Neera Tanden, then Staff Secretary to POTUS Biden, has a son who at that time was about 15? I drifted towards depression myself at that age, and I think it was largely due to 9/11. My mother may disagree, or at least feel like that shouldn't matter as much, it didn't affect her so why would it affect me differently at 15? Obviously something else happened to me, and it was probably my own choices and not politics out of my personal control.

I personally at the time of March 2022 did not know Neera Tanden was even in the Biden adminstration directly, nor that she had a son that was 15 at the time. Or that she has focused her childhood trauma of being abandoned by her father, leaving her and her mother to welfare, as part of her political persona. Nothing echoes in our minds quite like the past, and nothing echoes quite like emotional trauma. The echoes can dictate our actions without us being wary of them.

When we feel abandoned, sometimes we act out to ensure we don't lose what we have - especially our families.

Have you ever heard of the term echo chambers?

...

Before I was cut off from Slack, I remember my last few messages to my direct boss, Eloise. At some point I felt like I was talking to her directly, and let her know I was stressed about this situation, and reflected a bit on growing up around 9/11. I noted that this was if racism was involved or even if it wasn't, something I was thinking she'd understand given her status as both a woman in tech but also an LGTBQ woman. I think she did, as much as she could, given the last thing I think she said to me.

> Eloise: I'm so sorry you have to go through this

There are a lot of reasons for you, when someone is expressing something uncertain to you -- even if they may be legitimately hallucinating, like, on drugs and stuff -- to support the other person's point of view, if they are expressing anxiety or emotional turbulence at the time, no matter how wild. I also acknoledged to Eloise that I could have been misreading coincidences.

But given the last few weeks, and that my comms were cut shortly after, I'm pretty sure my direct boss Eloise was trying to let me know that yes, I was going through this.

It wasn't nothing.

...

After hearing from the HR person, I stayed on the phone and called the rents. I'm pretty sure we did the thing where I called one of them, and was called back by the other one shortly afterwards, whom was on speakerphone so both my parents could talk and hear me.

That is, as far as the phone calls we've had in the past, pretty standard of them.

I told them about the situation briefly with the same POV I gave to my direct boss Eloise: that a mishap over audio surveillance may have triggered some weird situation where my job got involved with the government and I was under an investigation of some kind, and I just wanted to clear things up if so, but they cut off my work communications and they told me they contacted my parents -- hence why I was calling.

My parents told me that yes, they had spoken to someone and mentioned the name of the HR person I recently spoke to, saying the young woman said that my computer was hacked and that she had stressed that I was _not_ under any kind of government investigation. Which was good to hear! I felt that could be possible for the next 48 hours or so, when I realized it most certainly was not, but that was Wednesday evening. When I spoke to my parents, it was Monday afternoon.

But, there were a few oddities in how they communicated further to me, a son they hadn't heard from in months.

My father, a company man at IBM for 30 years, and someone who never spoke ill of their bosses or coworkers around family -- at least not around his kids --, and whose advice to me has always been to get a graduated degree and be a lawyer or doctor and not a computer programmer like him, started telling me that I should take some sort of action, do something if I felt this was inappropriate.

I can't remember his exact language. But I remember his cadence; he was having fun. There was the air of pleasure in his voice, as he was saying something that I just didn't think he'd ever say.

I was surprised he wasn't yelling at me for causing trouble.

Furthermore, their reaction to what I felt would be my most obvious query given the situation was most surprising.

My sister went straight to law school at the University of Michigan after graduating from Brown University. She spent some time working at a division of the E.E.O.C., or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commision of the US Federal Government while in California. The EEOC is described as the following from Wikipedia:

> The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal agency that was established via the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to administer and enforce civil rights laws against workplace discrimination. Wikipedia

For awhile after that, my sister worked in Hawaii, at a University as a employee dispute negotiatiator. This was not only from her experience at the EEOC, but she also spent time in Hawaii running a legal practice focused on "conflict mediation" with a sub focus on corporate negotiations.

I'm not checking the wayback machine for my stupid sister's dumb little website (nts: you sohuld probably do this). But she literally - literally - once had this story up about how she helped a company with an employee who thought something was racist, when really it was a big misundertanding! They rehired the employee in a new department that more fit their skills and everyone was super happy! Or some such advertising shit.

Look, it was her practice. I don't think it did well, for what it's worth.

At the time of 2022, she had moved back to California and had been working within the 9th circuit of the US Federal Court system, which has San Francisco in it's jurisdiction (nts: check), as a DEI officer.

It's a pretty solid resume she has.

It would seem, to me, if the parents knew, and she knew, that would make sense. Sure.

I had thoguht, at the time, if I could shift this to my sister - and how reasonable it would have been for her to help me given her resume! To at least hear out her own brother in not only his time of need but in a time of need that literally mapped to her skillset and career history! - anyway, if I could shift this clown car to have Amrita as a driver, I might get a job somewhere else, or a new job at Vouch, and she'd have a nice little resume bump within DC as the person that cleaned up a shit show.

When I asked my parents, whom I was estranged to, if they could ask my older sister Amrita if she could help me, given her resume especially, and mentioning a possible connection with the CEO, I was surprised that my parents responded by saying she was quite "busy."

My parents would identify as professionals above and beyond anything else. It is their core identity.

I was shocked, but it confirmed to me, whom knows his family quite well thank you very much, that they were all involved to some extent.

I didn't want to think about how crazy that _coudl_ be - if I was under any sort of federal level investigation, it really wouldn't be taht crazy for them to have been involved.

It just _could_ be really crazy. But I didn't want to think about it.

I told them I would reach out to Amrita myself on LinkedIn just to make sure, and I left my parents to themselves after that.

...

I told the HR person and the company lawyer, whom I was in email correspondence with about the "hacking", that I woudl contact my sister and ask her if she could help in this situation. I provided her LinkedIn, gave a brief history of her, and let them know I thought highly of Amrita and thought she could be the one person who may help us in this situation. They responded amicably.

I messaged my sister on LinkedIn, saying that I worked at Vouch, and that a Sam Hodges runs the company as the CEO and seems to possibly have gone to Brown Univesity when you did. Either way, it would really help if you could just hear me out given the situation is a workplace one that I think involves racism to some degree. Did she have time for like a thirty minute phone call?

#### Tuesday, 3/15/2022

I wasn't surprised, given that I had calculated for at least some such bullshit, but I was dissapointed when my sister responded the next day saying that she was sorry, this just wasn't her line of expertise, and she couldn't help. She did say something like this, though:

> I'm not in touch with him, but I knew Sam Hodges in college, and he's a good man.

Look, I still haven't read _1984_, but as my sister's kid brother, I started to wonder if being the oldest child stunts you in future adult situations with so many "Big Brothers". But I digress.

I was shocked my sister didn't take control of the situation, and moreso that it felt like she _couldn't_. But I'm still not sure.

She always wanted to be an actress, though. That I know.

Given how I had introduced her as a possibility to my then co workers at vouch, the HR person and the company lawyer, I did feel a bit embarassed.

And I was on my own.

If they wanted to do this the hard way, and try and turn my family against me, then I was going to make this as awkward as humanly possible for all the leadership elements involved. 

_If they ever try and do anything like this again, it should trigger within them memories of a social situation so depressing and vile that they come as close to mentally gagging as one can, and do anything else besides play games with audio surveillance._

I had to feel out the lawyer first. How confident are they going to be sending emails to a server the company doesn't own? I was talking via my own Gmail account from that moment on.

From that point on I started laying bread crumbs in digital places that weren't owned by the people positioning themselves against me, which, at that point I felt were at least Vouch and then separately a political faction within the Federal Government. That way I could prove people were spying on me and analyze their usage of information against how they could have gotten it, digitally speaking, as well as in the case of my "untimely demise," leave a pattern of evidence that would cause at least an investigation.

I was on my own and I knew it. However, if I could set a precedent it would protect many others in a future of uncertainty.

First, I had to feel out the lawyer.

...

Vouch's legal representative -- I'm not sure if her official title was GC or general counsel but I digress - Ms. Wulff seemed to be leading the communications to me. She wanted to setup a meeting to talk about the "hacking".

Her background was in law, and she was telling me that the company, a tech company, was claiming I had been hacked.

I told the lawyer that because the situation concerns hacking, a technical concept, and I have a separate side of the story, that I'd feel comfortable sharing my side only if one or two people could join the meeting, preferabbly both: my tech manager, whom I felt comfortable with given her LGBTQ status as well, but perhaps more tellingly, the company's own tech security professional, a man I had to look up on LinkedIn named Cody - I had seen him chat previously in the company channels.

I also at the time found out Cody went to college with the brown man with the shared colloquial dialogue from that one meeting where the CEO flinched noticeably, but that's separate.

The lawyer, Ms. Kelly Wulff, immediately refused and said that only she could hear the details of my side of the story; and then she would take the details internally.

Apparently, I was already an external factor to the company.

That said, I was more flabbergasted that a company with 8 figures funding, likely involved with the federal government, would be foolish enough to hire a lawyer who would so brazenly leave a documented email chain showing their unwillingness to allow my perspective to be heard by technical professionals.

What's the point of a lawyer's expertise if they use it to hold back the expertise of others?

It sounds like a philosophical point of debate in a second year law class where ultimately, yes, a lawyer's responsibility is to protect their client, and that is the lesson.

What was Vouch so afraid of to let me speak my side to a tech professional like Cody or at least Eloise?

Did you read the previous parts of my memoir here reader? What do you think?

I had prepared internally for a conversation where I would be talking about the Blue Screen Of Death, something that happened before I started, and something that would indicate a "hacking" moreso than me sending messages I know I sent. I wanted to read Cody's and/or perhaps' Eloise's facial reactions ot my recollections to see if they knew anything as well.

I was confident in my ability ot read others, but I guess Ms. Wulff was suspicious of this as well.

A lawyer's first and foremost duty is to protect their client.

I was embarassed to have to start Tuesday by telling Vouch my sister couldn't help me out, but given how Ms. Wulff reacted, I think she smelled weakness in me given Amrita's lack of willingness to protect me as a client.

Funny, I smelled the same thing.

...

I mostly wanted to setup an email chain that would make clear that Vouch, at the time, felt it more necessary to protect their client from a potential truth rather than take the time to technically validate what their employee claimed to be the truth.

I mean, Ms. Wulff could've just setup the meeting, she didn't have to take the bait.

But she did, and at that point I realized at least internally that Vouch was more afraid of me and what I knew than anything else.

I ended Tuesday evening giving Ms. Wulff the impression that maybe I was considering that I actually _was_ hacked. This was to buy some time.

I mean, given how Vouch played it, if I wanted to play along, I could still be there, and whenever something didn't go my way, I'd have the ability to dangle that above the literal CEO for what they did to me. And it would work.

That said -- I ahd to ask myself -- with _complete disrespect_ to what happened with regards to any potential investigations, private or governmentally influenced, was Vouch a company worth staying at?

I thought about the attrition, particularly amongst female leadership and ground floor employees, with accusations of sexism already existing before I got there.

I thgouht about the poor to non existent communication between the C levels and the tech leadership.

I looked at the codebase and realized I ran the `git blame` command way more often than the `git commit` command -- the latter is only important when they give you work to commit to after all. The former is perhaps poorly named but, I had to face facts.

Vouch was a poorly run and poorly managed company. The funding they received and the resumes of their founders made them even more of an embarrasment.

This of course led to the situation I was in, but my situation wasn't the only thing emblemic of this company that said I'd be better off elsewhere.

I went to sleep asking myself this:

_Am I really getting paid enough to work at a company which has poor business practices and is bigotted enough to target me the way they did, and then pretend they can pretend their way out of it?_

_Am I being paid enough to believe someone else's lie over my own truth?_

> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16

March 16 2022 I made a choice that I will never regret: if I am to live one life, it will be one of my own writing.

No one will take my story from me, not now, and not ever.

Reader, had I realized I was on a Netflix Show, and knew about the Razzlekhan thing -

I probably would've been more pissed off than I was.

I let Ms. Wulff know and later that afternoon received a severance agreement.

It covered about 6 weeks of pay. It was basically enough time to get another job, hopefully, without any financial loss.

I was a bit concerned. The company clearly felt that they didn't do much wrong here beyond your average employee dispute.

It almost felt like they were pricing my situation at 6 weeks of emotional trauma.

Standard DEI severance package for one of those "uppity" minorities that just need to be "bucked" somewhere else, it smelled.

Maybe I could have been more grateful, and if I'm not going to be treated with honesty, then I'd like the lie to cover more therapy sessions and make it easier to find other employment.

You people turned my literal family against me.

Anyway, I took some time and realized I couldn't get more, so I accepted the offer, and wrote a long email explaining my perspective.

...

> PRIMARILY: I have no knowledge of being hacked, but I did send messages to multiple people this past weekend saying I began to suspect a network of people within the company suggesting I am a "Russian hacker" or an "Indian scammer."
>
> I made those messages myself. I contacted Eloise and then escalated to the CEO and CIO. My comms were shut down shortly with the excuse that I was "hacked" as though I was a rapper making homophobic comments on Twitter I regret - horseshit. I do consider the company to have reacted in a retaliatory fashion, but I have no interest in pursuing such an argument in arbitration. I'm suspicious you shut down my Slack or prevented messages from being sent when I communicated to Eloise the above on Saturday, which is a disgusting tactic and in a better world you would be held to a legal standard that would allow me to communicate my fears of racial persecution directly to my manager without being ex-communicated from the company or sent directly to a lawyer who can use my words against me. But maybe I'm wrong, anyway.
> 
> I do understand multiple people have their hands on "comms down" triggers and such. I don't know if there was a security firm involved. I do think the company should review the steps they took against the messages I sent - I did send them - and whether it's appropriate for the ideals of it's DEI based image. A major crypto company's CEO is OK with rascist and sexist weirdos, maybe you should just embrace that instead.

> 1. Surveillance - In the battlefield, "intelligence" can be gathered by audio surveillance, but it can also be used against you as "counterintelligence" - if the company is engaging in such surveillance: led by C levels, this is a business liability best avoided by contracting with a 3rd party firm. Put another way: Edward Snowden was just some desk jockey, or, business executives don't know the first thing about intelligence and will only create liabilities this way tripping over their own false positives, cognitive biases, and internal gender and racial biases. Not to mention general lack of experience. Practice makes perfect, get to changing before you really embarrass yourselves here.

[Black female HR rep] - work with [White female HR rep] and the HR onboarding team to ensure if a minority is asking for help with a background check form, to leave the idea of suspicion to the background check people. I just wanted to confirm the zip code because I'm not familiar with San Fran or the company. I texted her for my SSN because I googled what would be safer, texting vs. email (neither), and if that gave the impression of sexual interest, I'd advise her to get over herself immediately, be a professional, and in the future respond appropriately and within a non-suspicious time frame. Furthermore, the company does not need an SSN sent via plain text if they are engaging with a background check organization, or if you are going to receive I9 forms. It's a bit weird you even ask and I'm offended if it drew up suspicion.

> As for the time frame, even if it was late on Friday, there were 3 people on the form - it was quite obvious there was a communication to pause before "something" was checked on. I'm near positive [the White female HR rep]'s instincts here colored my entire experience poorly and flagged me for no good reason. And even if I'm wrong the hint of these suspicions are traumatic and it'd be better to avoid.

If a lawyer hears about Gossip that may be assessed for its intent visually, that lawyer is failing at their duty if they engage in or encourage that Gossip as they cannot understand all the ways they are perceived or received, plus their communications take an air of authority that institutionalizes bigotry via Gossip.

> Going back to Emit Til - GOOD MINORITIES DIE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE GOSSIP. This is a very immature company to even consider this more of a legal issue than a matter that could have been resolved with a direct conversation, but that goes to show what leadership cares about - not their employees.

> This is NOT a people-first organization, you should stop lying as it creates employee retention problems. You aren't what you say you are and people keep leaving. The only thing not obvious is whether leadership is capable of acting on the knowledge that they may be flawed.

> 5. Anchoring - The problem with bias is you anchor people to concepts - Indians are scammers, women are evil, and so forth. However, just like pricing economics - anchoring is incredibly effective. The danger of gossip is that you create anchor points and if they are racially biased, it is incredibly hard to take off.
> 
> I'm comfortable leaving because my confidence that at the very least I am rumored to be something I am not is so high, that I don't need to be anchored to the concept of "well at least he's not a terrorist." or whatever - I cannot be judged for my own merits, just as something I may not be as it's always stuck in yoru head. Similarly to how you two wish to be judged as professionals on your own merit, not "lady professionals" - ANCHORING AND GOSSIP MAKE EQUALITY IMPOSSIBLE.

> 6. Previous departures, are women safe here? - Rachel Bird got 2 months and came back for a week, and still felt unsafe, at least emotionally, and left. Ronnie left the same amazing equity position and yet in her interview with me, it made sense that she left before I got here - this is one of the most subtly dehumanizing workplaces I've been to because the leadership does not realize they aren't whom they claim to be with regards to inclusivity. You got rats in your nest and a month in your name ain't doing anything about that. I hope things work out for you all after the cliff, but my past issues aside I can understand why my sister didn't engage - you all stink to high heaven, and though she didn't say anything, I'll assume her experiences with Sam at Brown would correlate. She wouldn't want to jeopardize her career or integrity and she saw it coming from a mile away. Also, she kind of hates me, so there's that.

> 7. Finally - I may be wrong about this but if whoever may have thought communicating via tampering with my internet connection in connection to points #1 and #3 was a good idea - I'm pretty sure they've done similar extra-legal actions to others in the past. It's not hard to profile via public divorce records who here divorced their wife right before joining this company to prevent her from making a dime off the best financial opportunity of his career, and can't help but sound like a scumbag even to me in the DEI chat on int'l womens day - or is it "woman" day?. That said, Rajat communicated something to me directly in the EPAD onboarding meeting that seemed to wink at the idea of John Wallace taking my internet connection down. I cannot confirm or deny anything past that, maybe you should talk to them and ask them why my internet connection went down twice in a way that would make me feel uncomfortable with connection to the concepts expressed in #1 or #3. They probably don't know anything of the sort, I'd imagine. I only have a sea of coincidental activity that would relate to a "patina of criminality" - but only if there was a crime related to me and the company, which so far hasn't happened.

I of course got a polite response. I remember thinking _that'll piss off these DEI Democrats._ Even if something as crazy as Kamala Harris, the first Jamaican Indian Female Vice President, being inolved were true.

But I still wasn't sure whether or not I was under any kind of gov't investigation at that point. I thought it was over.

That evening, I was proven wrong.

...

Legacy is the name of a marijuana store I became a regular customer to in late 2021. Legacy was partially owned by a very famous if "indie" rap group _Dead Prez_, a group that never shied from politics. The store itself seemed to largely be run by Jamaican tinged African Americans, at least to my assumptions.

It was the first store I found in my area when I heard marijuana was being sold in stores in NYC. There were others later, but this was the closest location in late 2021. By the time I was at Vouch in early 2022, I had become a regular.

I even had one of those cards they'd punch holes into and give you free weed on your tenth purchase.

I had been through a couple of them by then.

Wednesday night I realized I was running low, but that was in the middle of me openly ranting in my apartment.

For the last week at least, I had warned the audio surveillance laptop that I was taking contemporanouse notes about all the oddities I experienced at Vouch.

I wasn't. I have an excellent memory and furthermore most key events were associated to either purchases or walks with purchases I could use to figure out dates of events, etc.

But I knew, to a bunch of feds, contemporaneous notes are sometimes all you need to make a legal argument.

But I wasn't taking notes. I was just talking out loud about how I ahd been.

I knew if they had been surveilling me _within_ my apartnemnt, this woudl create a lack of confidence - if I _wasn't_ bluffing, how was I writing notes without them knowing?

_Would they be stupid enough to let me lead them on when they surely have more than enough surveillance technology to confirm I'm lying?_
