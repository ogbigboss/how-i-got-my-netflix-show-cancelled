I wanted a direct confrontation about this, which I was pretty sure something they didn't want, but I realized that if I brought it up and they reacted more strongly than the situation warranted, it was probably the best answer I'd get as to whether or not they fooled their way into incriminating the federal government.

Also, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

Alas, I never got a direct confrontation from my bosses.

...

#### Sunday, 3/13/2022

I tried not responding, but I believe I cracked on Sunday of that week.

I also thought that waving a flag early may help someone on Vouch's side -- or whomever, really -- react more quickly.

I was through being coy; I would have told them up front what was a lie and what wasn't, and we could have moved on from there. They could have fired me. I would've preferred they just had done so; it would've sent the same message they sent anyway when they later told me my machine was hacked for sending the messages I knew I sent.

Vouch didn't care what my life experience was like, they stopped having empathy for me awhile ago if they ever did in the first place.

I think I kept remembering the CEO saying the company motto with regards to how they treat their employees with "the golden rule" -- treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated -- all after I was pretty sure I was under audio surveillance, had law authorities involved to some extent, and on top of all that, had my boss asking questions like I was in the 1940's facing a McCarthyist inquisition; not like I was in the 2020's at a company espousing DEI of all things.

That said, though I was a brown man, my makeshift McCarthyist middle manager was a LGBTQ woman, so I guess things have gotten more diverse.

...

Based on their cadences, I was suspicious of one of my other coworkers being told something gossipy, though either not of alarm, or, they simply weren't alarmed.

Or, of course, they knew nothing, or nothing was happening.

Either way they seemed like a person who, if the above were true, would respond near immediately, and I had seen them pop in on the weekend often.

This person, not my boss or the CEO, weren't high up the food chain, but if they didn't respond, I would take that as a pretty strong indicator that they knew something and couldn't - most normal people would respond with concern to the below, I'd assume:

> "Hey, I know this is weird, but I feel like there may be a company rumour that started about me being a 'hacker' or 'scammer' of some kind. I think it may have had to do with some oddities and miscommunications when joining with regards to the background check and greater onboarding process. Would you mind telling me if I'm totally off here?"

Reader, they of course did not respond. It was the weekend but it was just an opening test. No, they didn't respond the next Monday.

I messaged my manager something a bit more direct the next day.

#### Monday, 3/14/2022

Reader, I could have been nicer about the whole thing.

But from the start I wanted to set a precedent - whomever did this shouldn't have and shouldn't, ever again, not to me or anyone else.

It took me a few days after last week's incidents to realize that if I don't hear from the company leadership, they oughta hear from me, because otherwise they probably wouldn't want to bring it up.

Being quiet about something like this is not the precedent I wanted to set.

I was hoping Vouch would at least understand that and have thought of an excuse for this "worst case scenario" - I caught them pointing the finger at me to the feds and they were wrong, surely people with their resumes would have done basic worst case scenario planning for something like this? Wouldn't the Government?

However, as to my urgency, I also did not want to spend years of my life working alongside people whom were gossipping about me being a criminal at the very start of our working relationships.

Even if things did work out I wanted my name cleared by everyone who heard about this nonsense, I deserved at least that from a company supporting the idea of "DEI" of all things.

Famed Israel-American psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnman spent much of their careers researching a concept called _anchoring_. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29#:~:text=Kahneman%20suggests%20that%20anchoring%20occurs,or%20low%20before%20their%20prediction)

> Kahneman and Tversky showed that people's judgements could be skewed either higher or lower when presented with random numbers either high or low before their prediction.

So, if you told someone the price of something was much higher than the cost it took to manufacture, and you were able to get them to agree to the higher price without the knowledge of the latter, you can see that "Anchoring" is something used quite often to control prices by psychosocial control such as marketing.

While Kahneman and Tversky's research in the mid 20th century was with regards to economic behavior, the topic of anchoring has since spread to be known as a generic cognitive bias equally at play for gender and race issues, and particularly in the workplace and academia.

From the US National Library of Medicine, [Race, Ethnicity, and Culture in the Medical Record: Implicit Bias or Patient Advocacy?
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685755/)

> Anchoring bias: when an initial piece of information (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis, age, race, ethnicity) is used to make subsequent judgments and interpretations of behavior, leading one to respond more favorably to verbal and non-verbal information that reinforces initial beliefs. For example, a patient who initially has been given a diagnosis of malingering may be subject to negative interpretations of behaviors, and other clinicians involved in the patientâ€™s care may anchor onto verbal and non-verbal information that confirms the initial belief that the patient is exaggerating or feigning symptoms for secondary gain.

My mind leapt to the fantastical part of my head that thinks of the worst case scenario - just in case:

_You know, if the Biden / Harris admin was involved somehow, I'm going to guess they are hip to how important it would be to set a precedent here before an entire industry anchors themselves to the concept of predatory audio surveillance for minority employees. They're the Democrats!_

But it was just a thought.

...

Monday morning, somewhere around 9 AM and before they would normally wake up as they lived in Michigan, messaged my immediate boss something like the below:

> Hey Eloise, this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling like there is at least a rumour being spread about me that I may be some sort of hacker, and at most I even might be under some sort of "investigation" as a result. I think the rumour started because of miscommunications over audio surveillance, possibly while I was watching my favorite show in the background, _Burn Notice_, about a spy.

Eloise responded within the hour, with some concern and saying they would ask about it up the chain, but, with a slight cadence that did not feel like the way they would write sentences.

It was just a hunch, but I had a feeling someone else was typing for Eloise. I didn't expect much of a response.

Maybe I should have waited longer. I certainly could have. I'm not sure it would have changed much.

I knew the C levels were on PST time for the most part, save for John Wallace.

At around 10:30 AM I believe, I sent a message to the CIO John Wallace and the CEO Sam Hodges, copy pasting what I told Eloise, but adding one extra line:

> And personally, if I was "put under an investigation" of some sort, and for some reason anyone was still suspicious of me for being something I'm not, I'd prefer they show up to my door so I can talk with my fists.

I mostly remember the part about the fists, I couldn't resist. I knew these people wanted to at least get away with pushing me around, otherwise they wouldn't of ever read as excited.

Otherwise they would've just asked me to stop fucking around. They had some opportunity, and no, I didn't realize I was on a Reality TV show at the time, and no, I'm not sure I care in retrospect.

Also, at the time, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

_What kind of fascism is this?_

I never got a response, and somwhere around noon, my access to Slack, the company's chat, and Google apps, the company's other main comms tool, were cut and I was signed out of everything.

I got a phone call from someone in HR.

...

I remember mostly being pissed off but realizing that that wasn't a way to act in this situation if they were gonna handle it this way.

My improv partners did NOT want to give me a single conversation where I would have the moral highground due to their actions against me. Fine, typical, but from the DEI Democrats? Nope. I wasn't going to let them off for this one, nope nope nope.

I sighed, and realized feigning fear to the best extent I could might make some sense, but I just don't think I had the motivation for it.

The HR person told me that the "company thinks I've been hacked" and that "strange messages were sent to Sam and John" which couldn't of been me.

They knew me so well, after all.

I took it all in like it was scenery, and responded to it as plainly as one could a beautiful landscape rolling by on a night train headed north by north west, which is to say, I didn't disagree with it, but I didn't think I was seeing the whole picture.

I told them that was interesting, and they told me something else - that they had contacted my emergency contacts.

_Why in the world would they contact my parents in this situation?_

Sure we were estranged, but I still have to put down _someone's_ number when I start jobs with insurance plans.

I hadn't really thought of bringing my family into the situation, to be honest. I had wondered about my sister, given her potential conenction to the CEO's college.

I believe at that point I tried explaining to the HR person what happened. They were a young African American woman who had earlier led the meeting on the Stonewall riots -- I thought they might like to know my side in brief, which I told them in a hurried and slightly fearful manner, that I think this had more to do with miscommunications over audio surveillance. I told her I think government workers were following me in the streets as a result.

I also told her that none of this was her fault; and that no matter what happens she should never blame herself. She seemed to appreciate that.

I knew my bosses were listening; I'm not an idiot.

I tried leaving anyone listening, but most plausibly the HR person, the feeling that I was afraid more than anything, and confused.

I was angry more than anything, along with annoyed:

_I have to call my parents now?_

...

As of that time, March 2022, me and the 'rents didn't talk regularly much. I asked them for a bit of financial support during Covid and they were happy to oblige, though not terribly happy to hear from me either. Other than that we've been "off again and on again" for more than a decade, with around maybe 3 years regularly speaking here and there.

My parents aren't very thrilled that I don't have a college degree: I ought to, by now, have at least two of them, at my age. It's a bit... unseemly. I think they're more angry about that than anything, and I don't have much intent to get one given my career as a web developer.

I haven't depended on them financially for over a decade now, and I'm proud of that given that I'm both a college dropout and the economy I've been employed in -- 2007 to 2022 -- has been more competitive than previous ones for folks of my generation. Most people I know in the city need their parents, at least more than I do. 

What if the reason I could live without their financial need AND do it without a college degree was because I was also some sort of criminal?

I'd like to have an emotionally steady relationship with my parents one day, but until then, I'm proud to have spent nearly 15 years not depending on them financially, with or without a college degree.

That all changed a few months later, when I realized that since at least March 2022, my parents had to be convinced by someone within the Federal Government that I may be a criminal, and may have convinced them right back that maybe, they were right.

Did you know that Neera Tanden, then Staff Secretary to POTUS Biden, had a son who at that time was about 15? I drifted towards depression myself at that age, and I think it was largely due to 9/11. My mother may disagree, or at least feel like that shouldn't matter as much, it didn't affect her so why would it affect me differently at 15? Obviously something else happened to me, and it was probably my own choices and not politics out of my personal control.

I personally at the time of March 2022 did not know Neera Tanden was even in the Biden adminstration directly, nor that she had a son that was 15 at the time. Or that she has focused her childhood trauma of being abandoned by her father, leaving her and her mother to welfare, as part of her political persona. Nothing echoes in our minds quite like the past, and nothing echoes quite like emotional trauma. The echoes can dictate our actions without us being wary of them.

When we feel abandoned, sometimes we act out to ensure we don't lose what we have - especially our families.

Have you ever heard of the term echo chambers?

...

Before I was cut off from Slack, I remember my last few messages to my direct boss, Eloise. At some point I felt like I was talking to her directly, and let her know I was stressed about this situation, particularly if racism was involved or even if it wasn't, something I was thinking she'd understand given her status as both a woman in tech but also an LGTBQ woman. I think she did, as much as she could, given the last thing I think she said to me.

> Eloise: I'm so sorry you have to go through this

There are a lot of reasons when someone -- even if they may be legitimately hallucinating, like, on drugs and stuff -- to support the other person's point of view, if they are expressing anxiety or emotional turbulence at the time, no matter how wild. I also acknoledged to Eloise that I could have been misreading coincidences.

But given the last few weeks, and that my comms were cut shortly after, I'm pretty sure my direct boss Eloise was trying to let me know that yes, I was going through this.

It wasn't nothing.
