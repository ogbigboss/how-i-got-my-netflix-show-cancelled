I wanted a direct confrontation about this, which I was pretty sure something they didn't want, but I realized that if I brought it up and they reacted more strongly than the situation warranted, it was probably the best answer I'd get as to whether or not they fooled their way into incriminating the federal government.

Also, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

Alas, I never got a direct confrontation from my bosses.

#### Sunday, 3/13/2022

I tried not responding, but I believe I cracked on Sunday of that week.

I also thought that waving a flag early may help someone on Vouch's side -- or whomever, really -- react more quickly.

I was through being coy; I would have told them up front what was a lie and what wasn't, and we could have moved on from there. They could have fired me. I would've preferred they just had done so; it would've sent the same message they sent anyway when they later told me my machine was hacked for sending the messages I knew I sent.

Vouch didn't care what my life experience was like, they stopped having empathy for me awhile ago if they ever did in the first place.

I think I kept remembering the CEO saying the company motto with regards to how they treat their employees with "the golden rule" -- treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated -- all after I was pretty sure I was under audio surveillance, had law authorities involved to some extent, and on top of all that, had my boss asking questions like I was in the 1940's facing a McCarthyist inquisition; not like I was in the 2020's at a company espousing DEI of all things.

That said, though I was a brown man, my makeshift McCarthyist middle manager was a LGBTQ woman, so I guess things have gotten more diverse.

...

Based on their cadences, I was suspicious of one of my other coworkers being told something gossipy, though either not of alarm, or, they simply weren't alarmed.

Or, of course, they knew nothing, or nothing was happening.

Either way they seemed like a person who, if the above were true, would respond near immediately, and I had seen them pop in on the weekend often.

This person, not my boss or the CEO, weren't high up the food chain, but if they didn't respond, I would take that as a pretty strong indicator that they knew something and couldn't - most normal people would respond with concern to the below, I'd assume:

> "Hey, I know this is weird, but I feel like there may be a company rumour that started about me being a 'hacker' or 'scammer' of some kind. I think it may have had to do with some oddities and miscommunications when joining with regards to the background check and greater onboarding process. Would you mind telling me if I'm totally off here?"

Reader, they of course did not respond. It was the weekend but it was just an opening test. No, they didn't respond the next Monday.

I messaged my manager something a bit more direct the next day.

Reader, I could have been nicer about the whole thing.

But from the start I wanted to set a precedent - whomever did this shouldn't have and shouldn't, ever again, not to me or anyone else.

It took me a few days after last week's incidents to realize that if I don't hear from the company leadership, they oughta hear from me, because otherwise they probably wouldn't want to bring it up.

Being quiet about something like this is not the precedent I wanted to set.

I was hoping Vouch would at least understand that and have thought of an excuse for this "worst case scenario" - I caught them pointing the finger at me to the feds and they were wrong, surely people with their resumes would have done basic worst case scenario planning for something like this? Wouldn't the Government?

However, as to my urgency, I also did not want to spend years of my life working alongside people whom were gossipping about me being a criminal at the very start of our working relationships.

Even if things did work out I wanted my name cleared by everyone who heard about this nonsense, I deserved at least that from a company supporting the idea of "DEI" of all things.

Famed behavior psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnman spent much of their careers researching a concept called _anchoring_. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29#:~:text=Kahneman%20suggests%20that%20anchoring%20occurs,or%20low%20before%20their%20prediction)

> Kahneman and Tversky showed that people's judgements could be skewed either higher or lower when presented with random numbers either high or low before their prediction.

So, if you told someone the price of something was much higher than the cost it took to manufacture, and you were able to get them to agree to the higher price without the knowledge of the latter, you can see that "Anchoring" is something used quite often to control prices by psychosocial control such as marketing.

While Kahneman and Tversky's research in the mid 20th century was with regards to economic behavior, the topic of anchoring has since spread to be known as a generic cognitive bias equally at play for gender and race issues, and particularly in the workplace and academia.

From the US National Library of Medicine, [Race, Ethnicity, and Culture in the Medical Record: Implicit Bias or Patient Advocacy?
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685755/)

> Anchoring bias: when an initial piece of information (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis, age, race, ethnicity) is used to make subsequent judgments and interpretations of behavior, leading one to respond more favorably to verbal and non-verbal information that reinforces initial beliefs. For example, a patient who initially has been given a diagnosis of malingering may be subject to negative interpretations of behaviors, and other clinicians involved in the patientâ€™s care may anchor onto verbal and non-verbal information that confirms the initial belief that the patient is exaggerating or feigning symptoms for secondary gain.

My mind leapt to the fantastical part of my head that thinks of the worst case scenario - just in case:

_You know, if the Biden / Harris admin was involved somehow, I'm going to guess they are hip to how important it would be to set a precedent here before an entire industry anchors themselves to the concept of predatory audio surveillance for minority employees. They're the Democrats!_
