I wanted a direct confrontation about this, which I was pretty sure something they didn't want, but I realized that if I brought it up and they reacted more strongly than the situation warranted, it was probably the best answer I'd get as to whether or not they fooled their way into incriminating the federal government.

Also, I was kind of pissed off about the whole thing.

Alas, I never got a direct confrontation from my bosses.

I tried not responding, but I believe I cracked on Sunday of that week.

I also thought that waving a flag early may help someone on Vouch's side -- or whomever, really -- react more quickly.

I was through being coy; I would have told them up front what was a lie and what wasn't, and we could have moved on from there. They could have fired me. I would've preferred they just had done so; it would've sent the same message they sent anyway when they later told me my machine was hacked for sending the messages I knew I sent.

Vouch didn't care what my life experience was like, they stopped having empathy for me awhile ago if they ever did in the first place.

I think I kept remembering the CEO saying the company motto with regards to how they treat their employees with "the golden rule" -- treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated -- all after I was pretty sure I was under audio surveillance, had law authorities involved to some extent, and on top of all that, had my boss asking questions like I was in the 1940's facing a McCarthyist inquisition; not like I was in the 2020's at a company espousing DEI of all things.

That said, though I was a brown man, my makeshift McCarthyist boss was a LGBTQ woman, so I guess things have gotten more diverse.

...

Based on their cadences, I was suspicious of one of my other coworkers being told something gossipy, though either not of alarm, or, they simply weren't alarmed.

Or, of course, they knew nothing, or nothing was happening.

Either way they seemed like a person who, if the above were true, would respond near immediately, and I had seen them pop in on the weekend often.

This person, not my boss or the CEO, weren't high up the food chain, but if they didn't respond, I would take that as a pretty strong indicator that they knew something and couldn't - most normal people would respond with concern to the below, I'd assume:

> "Hey, I know this is weird, but I feel like there may be a company rumour that started about me being a 'hacker' or 'scammer' of some kind. I think it may have had to do with some oddities and miscommunications when joining with regards to the background check and greater onboarding process. Would you mind telling me if I'm totally off here?"

Reader, they of course did not respond. It was the weekend but it was just an opening test. No, they didn't respond the next Monday.

I messaged my manager something a bit more direct the next day.
