> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16

March 16 2022 I made a choice that I will never regret: if I am to live one life, it will be one of my own writing.

No one will take my story from me, not now, and not ever.

Reader, had I realized I was on a Netflix Show, and knew about the Razzlekhan thing -

I probably would've been more pissed off than I was.

I let Ms. Wulff know and later that afternoon received a severance agreement.

It covered about 6 weeks of pay. It was basically enough time to get another job, hopefully, without any financial loss.

I was a bit concerned. The company clearly felt that they didn't do much wrong here beyond your average employee dispute.

It almost felt like they were pricing my situation at 6 weeks of emotional trauma.

Standard DEI severance package for one of those "uppity" minorities that just need to be "bucked" somewhere else, it smelled.

Maybe I could have been more grateful, and if I'm not going to be treated with honesty, then I'd like the lie to cover more therapy sessions and make it easier to find other employment.

You people turned my literal family against me.

Anyway, I took some time and realized I couldn't get more, so I accepted the offer, and wrote a long email explaining my perspective.

...

> PRIMARILY: I have no knowledge of being hacked, but I did send messages to multiple people this past weekend saying I began to suspect a network of people within the company suggesting I am a "Russian hacker" or an "Indian scammer."
>
> I made those messages myself. I contacted Eloise and then escalated to the CEO and CIO. My comms were shut down shortly with the excuse that I was "hacked" as though I was a rapper making homophobic comments on Twitter I regret - horseshit. I do consider the company to have reacted in a retaliatory fashion, but I have no interest in pursuing such an argument in arbitration. I'm suspicious you shut down my Slack or prevented messages from being sent when I communicated to Eloise the above on Saturday, which is a disgusting tactic and in a better world you would be held to a legal standard that would allow me to communicate my fears of racial persecution directly to my manager without being ex-communicated from the company or sent directly to a lawyer who can use my words against me. But maybe I'm wrong, anyway.
> 
> I do understand multiple people have their hands on "comms down" triggers and such. I don't know if there was a security firm involved. I do think the company should review the steps they took against the messages I sent - I did send them - and whether it's appropriate for the ideals of it's DEI based image. A major crypto company's CEO is OK with rascist and sexist weirdos, maybe you should just embrace that instead.
> 
> Anyway -
> 
> Final assesments:
> 
> 1. Surveillance - In the battlefield, "intelligence" can be gathered by audio surveillance, but it can also be used against you as "counterintelligence" - if the company is engaging in such surveillance: led by C levels, this is a business liability best avoided by contracting with a 3rd party firm. Put another way: Edward Snowden was just some desk jockey, or, business executives don't know the first thing about intelligence and will only create liabilities this way tripping over their own false positives, cognitive biases, and internal gender and racial biases. Not to mention general lack of experience. Practice makes perfect, get to changing before you really embarrass yourselves here.
> 
> 2. [Black female HR rep] - work with [White female HR rep] and the HR onboarding team to ensure if a minority is asking for help with a background check form, to leave the idea of suspicion to the background check people. I just wanted to confirm the zip code because I'm not familiar with San Fran or the company. I texted her for my SSN because I googled what would be safer, texting vs. email (neither), and if that gave the impression of sexual interest, I'd advise her to get over herself immediately, be a professional, and in the future respond appropriately and within a non-suspicious time frame. Furthermore, the company does not need an SSN sent via plain text if they are engaging with a background check organization, or if you are going to receive I9 forms. It's a bit weird you even ask and I'm offended if it drew up suspicion.
> 
> As for the time frame, even if it was late on Friday, there were 3 people on the form - it was quite obvious there was a communication to pause before "something" was checked on. I'm near positive [the White female HR rep]'s instincts here colored my entire experience poorly and flagged me for no good reason. And even if I'm wrong the hint of these suspicions are traumatic and it'd be better to avoid.
>
> I'm not Emit Til, but these situations stink to high heaven. Even if I'm wrong, get it right next time so no one has to feel endangered by blonde white women - I'd rather not make analogies to "K" names, that's rascist.
> 
> 3. Cyberdefense - The best defense is not offense. Similiar to #1, an attack will put you in a posture that makes you weak should the attack either fail or be thwarted for whatever reason. Furthermore, it may make new employees really suspicious about why their super boring computer habits got a bit weird all of a sudden; especially if the HR team hasn't gotten back to them about a simple 5 digit zip code and they already were concerned about appearing shady.
> 
> 4. Gossip - Gossip is not a useful legal structure, particularly if lawyers reveal they may be connected. Gossip becomes a legal liability quickly, or at least contributes to stunning lacks of confidence. If Gossip can be about a new employee's speculative legal concerns, it shouldn't be Gossip. If a lawyer hears about Gossip that may be assessed for its intent visually, that lawyer is failing at their duty if they engage in or encourage that Gossip as they cannot understand all the ways they are perceived or received, plus their communications take an air of authority that institutionalizes bigotry via Gossip.
> 
> Going back to Emit Til - GOOD MINORITIES DIE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE GOSSIP. This is a very immature company to even consider this more of a legal issue than a matter that could have been resolved with a direct conversation, but that goes to show what leadership cares about - not their employees.
> 
> This is NOT a people-first organization, you should stop lying as it creates employee retention problems. You aren't what you say you are and people keep leaving. The only thing not obvious is whether leadership is capable of acting on the knowledge that they may be flawed.
> 
> 5. Anchoring - The problem with bias is you anchor people to concepts - Indians are scammers, women are evil, and so forth. However, just like pricing economics - anchoring is incredibly effective. The danger of gossip is that you create anchor points and if they are racially biased, it is incredibly hard to take off.
> 
> I'm comfortable leaving because my confidence that at the very least I am rumored to be something I am not is so high, that I don't need to be anchored to the concept of "well at least he's not a terrorist." or whatever - I cannot be judged for my own merits, just as something I may not be as it's always stuck in yoru head. Similarly to how you two wish to be judged as professionals on your own merit, not "lady professionals" - ANCHORING AND GOSSIP MAKE EQUALITY IMPOSSIBLE.
> 
> 6. Previous departures, are women safe here? - Rachel Bird got 2 months and came back for a week, and still felt unsafe, at least emotionally, and left. Ronnie left the same amazing equity position and yet in her interview with me, it made sense that she left before I got here - this is one of the most subtly dehumanizing workplaces I've been to because the leadership does not realize they aren't whom they claim to be with regards to inclusivity. You got rats in your nest and a month in your name ain't doing anything about that. I hope things work out for you all after the cliff, but my past issues aside I can understand why my sister didn't engage - you all stink to high heaven, and though she didn't say anything, I'll assume her experiences with Sam at Brown would correlate. She wouldn't want to jeopardize her career or integrity and she saw it coming from a mile away. Also, she kind of hates me, so there's that.
> 
> 7. Finally - I may be wrong about this but if whoever may have thought communicating via tampering with my internet connection in connection to points #1 and #3 was a good idea - I'm pretty sure they've done similar extra-legal actions to others in the past. It's not hard to profile via public divorce records who here divorced their wife right before joining this company to prevent her from making a dime off the best financial opportunity of his career, and can't help but sound like a scumbag even to me in the DEI chat on int'l womens day - or is it "woman" day?. That said, Rajat communicated something to me directly in the EPAD onboarding meeting that seemed to wink at the idea of John Wallace taking my internet connection down. I cannot confirm or deny anything past that, maybe you should talk to them and ask them why my internet connection went down twice in a way that would make me feel uncomfortable with connection to the concepts expressed in #1 or #3. They probably don't know anything of the sort, I'd imagine. I only have a sea of coincidental activity that would relate to a "patina of criminality" - but only if there was a crime related to me and the company, which so far hasn't happened.
> 
> I'm more than likely wrong, or just connecting things that are coincidences. But if I'm right, that guy ain't pulling that cheap move again.
> 
> And if wants to see me face to face he knows where I live; he always has. I wish to not speak further on point #7, unless it's with my fists.

I of course got a polite response. I remember thinking _that'll piss off these DEI Democrats._ Even if something as crazy as Kamala Harris, the first Jamaican Indian Female Vice President, being inolved were true.

But I still wasn't sure whether or not I was under any kind of gov't investigation at that point. I thought it was over.

That evening, I was proven wrong.

...

Legacy is the name of a marijuana store I became a regular customer to in late 2021. Legacy was partially owned by a very famous if "indie" rap group _Dead Prez_, a group that never shied from politics. The store itself seemed to largely be run by Jamaican tinged African Americans, at least to my assumptions.

It was the first store I found in my area when I heard marijuana was being sold in stores in NYC. There were others later, but this was the closest location in late 2021. By the time I was at Vouch in early 2022, I had become a regular.

I even had one of those cards they'd punch holes into and give you free weed on your tenth purchase.

I had been through a couple of them by then.

Wednesday night I realized I was running low, but that was in the middle of me openly ranting in my apartment.

For the last week at least, I had warned the audio surveillance laptop that I was taking contemporanouse notes about all the oddities I experienced at Vouch.

I wasn't. I have an excellent memory and furthermore most key events were associated to either purchases or walks with purchases I could use to figure out dates of events, etc.

But I knew, to a bunch of feds, contemporaneous notes are sometimes all you need to make a legal argument.

But I wasn't taking notes. I was just talking out loud about how I ahd been.

I knew if they had been surveilling me _within_ my apartnemnt, this woudl create a lack of confidence - if I _wasn't_ bluffing, how was I writing notes without them knowing?

_Would they be stupid enough to let me lead them on when they surely have more than enough surveillance technology to confirm I'm lying?_

It was around 8 PM that evening I believe. I said something like this, and made sure I was distant from the Laptop such that if anyone heard, they would've had to have an audio bug in my main living room (where the laptop was not), or used some kind of long distance audio "gun" to hear what I was saying based on the vibrations my voice made against the glass window I was speaking out towards, saying something like this:

> Oh, so you people are business insurance types? Well I got my own insurance plan to make sure that if you keep coming after me, every internationalist journalist and interested financial parties will know automatically. I'm a computer hacker remember?

Reader, again, what type of effective criminal just... brags like that? Openly?

I thought that for sure by playing something that read more like a "netflix" character, actual law enforcement types would read me as bluffing - many people claim to be, for instance, famous criminals and act as though they are confessing just for the thrill of claiming they were the famous "In-n-out burger thief" or some such nick names.

Had I known I was actually on a Netflix show being scouted for an expansion to their _Razzlekhan_ production, maybe I would've done something differently.

I walked over to my computer that is clearly by the window in my living room and grabbed the largest USB stick I have, which I had moved to this computer earlier on purpose for this exact stunt.

Would anyone watching me now be stupid enough to reveal that they can hear and see what I do _without_ the company laptop being nearby?

And would they do so by obviously reacting?

What would that say about my captor's emotional states, to be so reactive?

I had to buy more marijuana. OK, I _wanted_ to buy more marijuana. I was running low.

I took the large USB stick, and made sure anyone from the window's perspective could see it and that I put it into my jacket as I left for the weed store.

...

On my walk over I felt no sign of being followed. The walk covers a particularly public area -- there was a decent amount of evening foot traffic, it was a nice enough night, not too cold -- so if I was wrong, then they were keeping their distance. Which, I thoguht, was good.

_If they're smart then they'll want me to feel safe so they can see what I'd do then. I'm not a criminal so the next few weeks I'll probably just be surveilled from a distance as I presume is a normal part of my life due to my previous entrepurenial ambitions and how many would misread them._

I walked into Legacy and saw Shaheem, a man in their mid 30s I had gotten used to buying marijuana from. We'd talk about weed strains and the Knicks, mostly. I mentioned to him how back in the day I bootleg'd copies of Dead Prez' _Let's Get Free_ and felt like my purchases were some sort of penance, as a joke.

Sometimes, there'd be younger black kids, late teen to early 20s types, hanging out at the store. This was one of those nights, some kids were hanging out on the couch to the left and behind me -- I was at the counter exchanging pleasentries with Shaheem and the other woman working with him.

Working with Shaheem was a young woman whom referred to herself as "Mars" -- she was the second such woman at the store I had met who did so; I assumed it was a joke between cousins that looked somewhat similar to tell people they were all named "Mars" though I had never brought this up. This "Mars" I internally called "Little Mars" because they seemed to be in their early 20s, the first "Mars" I met was in her 30s and a bit taller as well, though I hadn't seen her since my first visit back in October of 2021. This was March of 2022.

Shaheem eventually goes to the back of store to retrieve the strain I asked for; normal. But while he was in the back, I felt "Little Mars" grow uncomfortable. I wonder if I had looked at her funny, or given her the impression I was leering. I worried a bit as the black kids to the left of me became noticeably quiet.

_Damn, did I really spook her that much?_

Shaheem comes out from the back and sees something behind me, and immediately gains tension as well. He starts asking one of the black kids for something, in a slightly serious tone, and then follows up by repeating something I had never heard him say, and as though it was a catch phrase of sorts:

> "Copy that, copy that"

Shaheem said in confirmation to something the other black kid said. He emphasized the "cop" in copy.

Get it?

I buy the weed and the uncomfortable feeling never dissapates. I begin to take a few paces backwards on purpose, and as I feel a presence, I turn around and see a bald white man in their 40s, built like they worked out, with a muscle set that spoke to possibly military experience in my opinion, and a face that read like a middle aged man that felt, well...

The guy looked uncomfortable, and guilty, like _they_ were in the wrong.

They were wearing an all blue outfit with little for labels or insignia.

I'm pretty sure he was some kind of law enforcement officer. By my emotional read, someone sent him to follow me in the store. By the timing -- it took at least 5 minutes of me being inside the store -- the team investigating me had a debate about it. On the one side, I might get spooked by a cop.

On the other side, maybe it's those _jamaican_ weed stores that I'm involved with.

I regret going to Legacy that night because of the black kids that were there.

I remember thinking on the walk home _Oh boy... Kamala Harris' estranged father... is jamaican... and they own a weed store... and she's the Vice President..._

I never touched the USB stick in my pocket. I made sure to not make any "weird" movements towards it while under the security cameras that Legacy has in the store's front.

I began to wonder what kind of law enforcement process cold be lead into a situation where you'd choose to make it obvious you were following me as opposed to just going into the store and asking to review their security camera footage, without making it obvious to me or the store what you were after?

It really felt like someone made an emotional decision, and a lot of people did _not_ want to make a bunch of black kids feel afraid of a law enforcement officer on a Wednesday night.

Would Kamala Harris feel that same fear? And if she didn't, could she be able to override others?

I had to ask myself: _who else would fit this equation better than her?_

I sighed. It was too much to think about. These people were idiots and I wasn't. That's all I knew. I had an eighth of weed and a lot of reasons to smoke it. I also knew that.

#### Thursday 3/17/2022

When I woke up, closer to the afternoon than I'd like to admit, I felt I had proof that yes, the situation I was in had to be a federal one.

It's really hard to know who else could authorize a barge to be filled with such radio equipment.

As I looked across the FDR and at Pier 35, a water craft that I had never seen the like of in my ten years of living adjacent to the East River appeared. It was covered in satellite equipment of all kinds pointed in all directions. It looked makeshift as fuck. I took some photos, and I thought this:

_These people think my USB stick had some radio frequency thing. They need to hold onto a fantasy of a theory and prove it by making up another fantasy. They literally could just detain me and check the stick - I bought it at a CVS. There's nothing fancy. But they'd rather believe their own fantasy._

I remembered free market economic theory. Samuelson's Revealed Preference Theory basically says that in markets, given little interference, society's preferences are revealed via the market activities that take place.

Did my bosses forget their basic principles in allowing the federal government to interfere? Or were they living proof that maybe, Samuelson's RPT has some other things getting in the way, and it may not be market activity?

I also realized that the reactions show someone who emotinally needs to appear "dominant" -- they need to make dramatic decisions that will pay off and show everyone that they were right all along, because they now feel threatened about how wrong they are appearing about me.

Otherwise they wouldn't of sent the guy to follow my into the store and be threatening to black kids.

Otherwise, they would have just detained and searched me -- I'm a child left behind, the patriot act still exists, it wasn't impossible for them -- however, if they did so, the risk of them looking stupid would be higher emotionally if things were held internally. Also, it would probably make for bad TV, PR wise.

So I thought a lot about how dominance is falsely prescribed due to misunderstandings of the "Alpha male" or for tha tmatter "Alpha female" stereotype being a real thing. It's not.

So I wrote another email to the lawyer.

I think I was emotionally compensating for being treated like a fucking idiot.

> Kelly,

> I'm about to sign the document. Thanks again for everything.

> At the risk of being a pedantic asshole -- way too late, nvm -- I'd like to leave the board, and particularly Mr. Hodges, whose grandmother was a scientist, one last thing - it's about investing and bias! He'd like it.

> The term "alpha male / female" is derived from "alpha wolf," coined via research from an ecologist named Dr. Meck in the early 80s publication The Wolf. He found there was always one "dominant" male and female wolf, their dominance proven via ruthless and often violent spats with other wolves: competition!

> It's later been found that in the wild, if there is an "alpha" male or female, it's just whoever is playing "mom" or "dad" to the cubs, with disrespect to biological connections. If you're in the pack, you're in, and the leader is the one who takes care of those who need help, not the warden who offers you dillemas as so many prisoners.
>
> But if that's proven, why does "alpha male / female" terminology, as well as outdated management and economics rooted in a genius / bigot's simplistic game theories* persist a global leadership crisis that courageous comedians and batshit game show hosts keep upending... if things are stupid, why do they "grow" despite Samuelson's vaunted revealed preference theory guaranteeing balance, far from stupidity?
>
> The below is a quote from a smallish Candian financial investment firm's blog that puts things better than I could:
>
> How do ideas for which there is an abundance of contradictory evidence perpetuate in mainstream consciousness? This is an important question to ask, whether we are considering wolves or investing. When we believe in ideas that have been falsified, we risk making sub-optimal decisions based on those beliefs. Asking this question helps us to a) understand how the ecosystem of ideas may be flawed, and therefore how it can be improved, and b) remind ourselves that much of the knowledge that we hold up as truth may not be; hence, it is a necessity to always ask ourselves how we know what we “know.”

Reader, I'm now near certain the above email triggered a compensatory behavior amongst the leadership "clique" that seeked to make me their career gain.

If you were wrong about me, what else could you be wrong about? They now could not be wrong about me and entered into a major sunken cost fallacy as they began to force me into their frame of reasoning for over a year, using intimidation techniques most often represented as Terrorist or Fascist, depending on how much the govenrnment and not a single political faction is in charge.

Also, I probably read more like a Soviet era _James Bond_ Villan than I realize.

I still haven't seen a single Sean Connery _James Bond_ movie, shaken _or_ stirred, for whatever it's worth.

And yes, had I known a TV show was on the line... I may have chosen other phrasings.

This is why I think it's important to seek consent as soon as possible for most things, but especially Reality TV. It's a weird perspective to have on consent, to tie it with privacy, but what do I know?

I just send emails to piss legal professionals off and leave a breadcrumb trail of evidence for a future federal investigator to clear my name and/or solve my future murder.

It's a big part of my thing these days.
