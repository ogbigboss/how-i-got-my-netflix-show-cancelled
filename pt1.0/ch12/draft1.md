> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16

March 16 2022 I made a choice that I will never regret: if I am to live one life, it will be one of my own writing.

No one will take my story from me, not now, and not ever.

Reader, had I realized I was on a Netflix Show, and knew about the Razzlekhan thing -

I probably would've been more pissed off than I was.

I let Ms. Wulff know and later that afternoon received a severance agreement.

It covered about 6 weeks of pay. It was basically enough time to get another job, hopefully, without any financial loss.

I was a bit concerned. The company clearly felt that they didn't do much wrong here beyond your average employee dispute.

It almost felt like they were pricing my situation at 6 weeks of emotional trauma.

Standard DEI severance package for one of those "uppity" minorities that just need to be "bucked" somewhere else, it smelled.

Maybe I could have been more grateful, and if I'm not going to be treated with honesty, then I'd like the lie to cover more therapy sessions and make it easier to find other employment.

You people turned my literal family against me.

Anyway, I took some time and realized I couldn't get more, so I accepted the offer, and wrote a long email explaining my perspective.

...

> PRIMARILY: I have no knowledge of being hacked, but I did send messages to multiple people this past weekend saying I began to suspect a network of people within the company suggesting I am a "Russian hacker" or an "Indian scammer."
>
> I made those messages myself. I contacted Eloise and then escalated to the CEO and CIO. My comms were shut down shortly with the excuse that I was "hacked" as though I was a rapper making homophobic comments on Twitter I regret - horseshit. I do consider the company to have reacted in a retaliatory fashion, but I have no interest in pursuing such an argument in arbitration. I'm suspicious you shut down my Slack or prevented messages from being sent when I communicated to Eloise the above on Saturday, which is a disgusting tactic and in a better world you would be held to a legal standard that would allow me to communicate my fears of racial persecution directly to my manager without being ex-communicated from the company or sent directly to a lawyer who can use my words against me. But maybe I'm wrong, anyway.
> 
> I do understand multiple people have their hands on "comms down" triggers and such. I don't know if there was a security firm involved. I do think the company should review the steps they took against the messages I sent - I did send them - and whether it's appropriate for the ideals of it's DEI based image. A major crypto company's CEO is OK with rascist and sexist weirdos, maybe you should just embrace that instead.
> 
> Anyway -
> 
> Final assesments:
> 
> 1. Surveillance - In the battlefield, "intelligence" can be gathered by audio surveillance, but it can also be used against you as "counterintelligence" - if the company is engaging in such surveillance: led by C levels, this is a business liability best avoided by contracting with a 3rd party firm. Put another way: Edward Snowden was just some desk jockey, or, business executives don't know the first thing about intelligence and will only create liabilities this way tripping over their own false positives, cognitive biases, and internal gender and racial biases. Not to mention general lack of experience. Practice makes perfect, get to changing before you really embarrass yourselves here.
> 
> 2. [Black female HR rep] - work with [White female HR rep] and the HR onboarding team to ensure if a minority is asking for help with a background check form, to leave the idea of suspicion to the background check people. I just wanted to confirm the zip code because I'm not familiar with San Fran or the company. I texted her for my SSN because I googled what would be safer, texting vs. email (neither), and if that gave the impression of sexual interest, I'd advise her to get over herself immediately, be a professional, and in the future respond appropriately and within a non-suspicious time frame. Furthermore, the company does not need an SSN sent via plain text if they are engaging with a background check organization, or if you are going to receive I9 forms. It's a bit weird you even ask and I'm offended if it drew up suspicion.
> 
> As for the time frame, even if it was late on Friday, there were 3 people on the form - it was quite obvious there was a communication to pause before "something" was checked on. I'm near positive [the White female HR rep]'s instincts here colored my entire experience poorly and flagged me for no good reason. And even if I'm wrong the hint of these suspicions are traumatic and it'd be better to avoid.
>
> I'm not Emit Til, but these situations stink to high heaven. Even if I'm wrong, get it right next time so no one has to feel endangered by blonde white women - I'd rather not make analogies to "K" names, that's rascist.
> 
> 3. Cyberdefense - The best defense is not offense. Similiar to #1, an attack will put you in a posture that makes you weak should the attack either fail or be thwarted for whatever reason. Furthermore, it may make new employees really suspicious about why their super boring computer habits got a bit weird all of a sudden; especially if the HR team hasn't gotten back to them about a simple 5 digit zip code and they already were concerned about appearing shady.
> 
> 4. Gossip - Gossip is not a useful legal structure, particularly if lawyers reveal they may be connected. Gossip becomes a legal liability quickly, or at least contributes to stunning lacks of confidence. If Gossip can be about a new employee's speculative legal concerns, it shouldn't be Gossip. If a lawyer hears about Gossip that may be assessed for its intent visually, that lawyer is failing at their duty if they engage in or encourage that Gossip as they cannot understand all the ways they are perceived or received, plus their communications take an air of authority that institutionalizes bigotry via Gossip.
> 
> Going back to Emit Til - GOOD MINORITIES DIE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE GOSSIP. This is a very immature company to even consider this more of a legal issue than a matter that could have been resolved with a direct conversation, but that goes to show what leadership cares about - not their employees.
> 
> This is NOT a people-first organization, you should stop lying as it creates employee retention problems. You aren't what you say you are and people keep leaving. The only thing not obvious is whether leadership is capable of acting on the knowledge that they may be flawed.
> 
> 5. Anchoring - The problem with bias is you anchor people to concepts - Indians are scammers, women are evil, and so forth. However, just like pricing economics - anchoring is incredibly effective. The danger of gossip is that you create anchor points and if they are racially biased, it is incredibly hard to take off.
> 
> I'm comfortable leaving because my confidence that at the very least I am rumored to be something I am not is so high, that I don't need to be anchored to the concept of "well at least he's not a terrorist." or whatever - I cannot be judged for my own merits, just as something I may not be as it's always stuck in yoru head. Similarly to how you two wish to be judged as professionals on your own merit, not "lady professionals" - ANCHORING AND GOSSIP MAKE EQUALITY IMPOSSIBLE.
> 
> 6. Previous departures, are women safe here? - Rachel Bird got 2 months and came back for a week, and still felt unsafe, at least emotionally, and left. Ronnie left the same amazing equity position and yet in her interview with me, it made sense that she left before I got here - this is one of the most subtly dehumanizing workplaces I've been to because the leadership does not realize they aren't whom they claim to be with regards to inclusivity. You got rats in your nest and a month in your name ain't doing anything about that. I hope things work out for you all after the cliff, but my past issues aside I can understand why my sister didn't engage - you all stink to high heaven, and though she didn't say anything, I'll assume her experiences with Sam at Brown would correlate. She wouldn't want to jeopardize her career or integrity and she saw it coming from a mile away. Also, she kind of hates me, so there's that.
> 
> 7. Finally - I may be wrong about this but if whoever may have thought communicating via tampering with my internet connection in connection to points #1 and #3 was a good idea - I'm pretty sure they've done similar extra-legal actions to others in the past. It's not hard to profile via public divorce records who here divorced their wife right before joining this company to prevent her from making a dime off the best financial opportunity of his career, and can't help but sound like a scumbag even to me in the DEI chat on int'l womens day - or is it "woman" day?. That said, Rajat communicated something to me directly in the EPAD onboarding meeting that seemed to wink at the idea of John Wallace taking my internet connection down. I cannot confirm or deny anything past that, maybe you should talk to them and ask them why my internet connection went down twice in a way that would make me feel uncomfortable with connection to the concepts expressed in #1 or #3. They probably don't know anything of the sort, I'd imagine. I only have a sea of coincidental activity that would relate to a "patina of criminality" - but only if there was a crime related to me and the company, which so far hasn't happened.
> 
> I'm more than likely wrong, or just connecting things that are coincidences. But if I'm right, that guy ain't pulling that cheap move again.
> 
> And if wants to see me face to face he knows where I live; he always has. I wish to not speak further on point #7, unless it's with my fists.

I of course got a polite response. I remember thinking _that'll piss off these DEI Democrats._ Even if something as crazy as Kamala Harris, the first Jamaican Indian Female Vice President, being inolved were true.

But I still wasn't sure whether or not I was under any kind of gov't investigation at that point. I thought it was over.

That evening, I was proven wrong.

...

Legacy is the name of a marijuana store I became a regular customer to in late 2021. Legacy was partially owned by a very famous if "indie" rap group _Dead Prez_, a group that never shied from politics. The store itself seemed to largely be run by Jamaican tinged African Americans, at least to my assumptions.

It was the first store I found in my area when I heard marijuana was being sold in stores in NYC. There were others later, but this was the closest location in late 2021. By the time I was at Vouch in early 2022, I had become a regular.

I even had one of those cards they'd punch holes into and give you free weed on your tenth purchase.

I had been through a couple of them by then.

Wednesday night I realized I was running low, but that was in the middle of me openly ranting in my apartment.

For the last week at least, I had warned the audio surveillance laptop that I was taking contemporanouse notes about all the oddities I experienced at Vouch.

I wasn't. I have an excellent memory and furthermore most key events were associated to either purchases or walks with purchases I could use to figure out dates of events, etc.

But I knew, to a bunch of feds, contemporaneous notes are sometimes all you need to make a legal argument.

But I wasn't taking notes. I was just talking out loud about how I ahd been.

I knew if they had been surveilling me _within_ my apartnemnt, this woudl create a lack of confidence - if I _wasn't_ bluffing, how was I writing notes without them knowing?

_Would they be stupid enough to let me lead them on when they surely have more than enough surveillance technology to confirm I'm lying?_
