I probably should _not_ be a role model for anything.

I definitely should _not_ be a role model for therapy's benefits, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Except for maybe to some like, classified CIA documents or some weird shit like that.

Reader, you may be looking back on my exercise, the one I do when I get "triggered", and asking yourself this:

`Ok. So the idea of being under a covert investigation, including the possibility of being framed such to legitimize said investigation, was triggering to you. That's understandable. Did this CBT therapy thing make you try to... turn it around, such that you acted that way? And without it, would you have just acted out of normal fear and anger, in a way that would have been easier to handle?`

Look man, I've been through a lot in my life that hasn't involved the CIA or CBT. I don't think my reactions were purely the result of the therapy I've become well, reflexive in utilizing when I feel triggered emotionally.

Normally I'm "turning around" things like... ok it's been awhile, to be honest. The stuff works.

But like a decade ago in my 20s, I had trouble with thoughts like "I'm not successful enough" and "my parents will never love me" and "everyone secretly hates me and is waiting for an opportunity to align with political, financial, and media forces to smear me before I can achieve my destiny".

When you turn around thoughts liek that, you end up with counters like "I'm actually very successful, let me count the ways," "my parents can get bent but they do love me in their own way particularly with how they raised me financially speaking", and "wow that's crazy shut up, are you hungry or something?"

It did take almost 5 or so years to get used to using that "system" to counter thoughts, and after around a decade, I'm not sure if I have the first thought - the trigger - without near automatically having the next, though, I may not have to count the ways I could be considered succesful as much.

But in this situation? Could I have made a better decision, with respect to the fact that I had no idea about Razzlekhan or felt that it was possible I was on a Netflix show?

...

In April, I'd learn about something I've heard about from my then therapist: DBT.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, separate though influenced by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, seems to have another system of dealing with complicated or "triggering" thoughts, albeit not one that counters CBT though in my dillettante's opinion, adds to it.

That said, the KHive DNC infiltrated my therapist through these events and I'm likely going to stay away from therapy until this situation can meet some resolution. I'm grateful I got to it well before as a result, and would encourage those not in my situation to seek therapy just as a way to explore yourself.

You don't need to be broken to be better.

But I digress. DBT, to me, as I was learning a bit about it in April, oddly seemed to somewhat represent the dialogue system in a video game I started playing that month as well: _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. Probably a coincidence, maybe not.

At any rate, DBT encourages you to see your brain as having two major "reflexive" response types to situations. I'm not certain on the correct terminology, but I remember it as "emotional" responses and "logical" responses.

DBT encourages you to ask what those persepectives are, then seek a third persepctive that incorporates both of those and helps decide the "best" decision: the wise mind.

Reader, the wise mind has nothing to do with the stereotypes you may or may have not heard about "wise guys", but that may not affect you as much as it does me.

I've often thought about this situation, and had I parsed it through DBT, how would I have reacted.

Given that I didn't think a private corporation like Netflix was involved, and it was most likely a government which has made a recent post 9/11 history of detaining at best and possibly torturing at worst brown civilians based on suspicions made of their race and their race alone?

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.

And in the furthest reaches of my mind I thought: _Well, Kamala Harris is half Indian, surely if this was that crazy she'd never let this go so far..._

But then I remembered, even in the furthest reaches of my mind, VP Harris' history in California of famously locking up 3rd offenders aggressively alongside seeking convictions against marijuana offenders to the point of earning a reputation.

Then I remembered, in the furthest reaches of my mind, that India has twice the population of the European continent yet was under various European colonist rule for four centuries.

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.
