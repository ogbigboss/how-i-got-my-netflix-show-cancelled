# Chapter 14

I probably should _not_ be a role model for anything.

I definitely should _not_ be a role model for therapy's benefits, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Except for maybe to some like, classified CIA documents or some weird shit like that.

Reader, you may be looking back on my exercise, the one I do when I get "triggered", and asking yourself this:

`Ok. So the idea of being under a covert investigation, including the possibility of being framed such to legitimize said investigation, was triggering to you. That's understandable. Did this CBT therapy thing make you try to... turn it around, such that you acted that way? And without it, would you have just acted out of normal fear and anger, in a way that would have been easier to handle?`

Look man, I've been through a lot in my life that hasn't involved the CIA or CBT. I don't think my reactions were purely the result of the therapy I've become well, reflexive in utilizing when I feel triggered emotionally.

Normally I'm "turning around" things like... ok it's been awhile, to be honest. The stuff works.

But like a decade ago in my 20s, I had trouble with thoughts like "I'm not successful enough" and "my parents will never love me" and "everyone secretly hates me and is waiting for an opportunity to align with political, financial, and media forces to smear me before I can achieve my destiny".

When you turn around thoughts liek that, you end up with counters like "I'm actually very successful, let me count the ways," "my parents can get bent but they do love me in their own way particularly with how they raised me financially speaking", and "wow that's crazy shut up, are you hungry or something?"

It did take almost 5 or so years to get used to using that "system" to counter thoughts, and after around a decade, I'm not sure if I have the first thought - the trigger - without near automatically having the next, though, I may not have to count the ways I could be considered succesful as much.

But in this situation? Could I have made a better decision, with respect to the fact that I had no idea about Razzlekhan or felt that it was possible I was on a Netflix show?

...

It's probably not from CBT, but another thing I picked up in therapy that works very nicely alongside being a programmer is basic "worst case scenario" planning.

In a situation that peaks your anxiety or triggers you or whatever, asking yourself some variety of "what the worst case scenario" or "what's the worst that could actually happen" is a great way to bring reality to measure against your emotions.

_I haven't heard from my tailor about the thing and I got the other thing I need the first thing for coming up tomorrow._

What's the worst that can happen?

_I'll have to use my backup thing to take care of the formerly mentioned thing such that I'll be good for the laterly mentioned thing._

Different things peak different people for different reasons. This fictitious person above has obviously had childhood trauma concerning button repairs on a family heirloom, and now refers to all dry cleaning arrangements as a mobster for some reason. That said, the dry cleaners triggers them, and they need to calm down, and this exercise helps them to get realistic.

In programming, it's usually a great way to ask yourself, well "if" this thing is true, what "else" may be true in opposition, and to an extreme bounds?

Anyway, I don't think that's CBT, it's pretty basic, and it's helpful in a lot of ways.

...

One of my first therapists introduced me to CBT, and as a budding computer programmer, I think I treated it like anything with three letters that stood for something else -- I wanted to know more about it. They told me a bit about it's history as well as some of it's luminaries and offshoots, namely, schema therapy.

They reccomended a book on schema therapy, and warned that it was rewritten as a "self help" book in order to fit a publisher's guidelines, and that the title was not actually a promise it could serve on.

The book is called _Reinventing Your Life_ by Jeffrey E. Young and Janet S. Klosko, both Ph.D.'s, if you're into that sort of thing. I keep it in a section of my apartment you'd have to break into to find, because I was more embarassed about having something like this on my bookshelf than any of the dozens of comic books, given it's title.

It describes what I believe are the 16 "schemas" in schema therapy as lifetraps. From the book, chapter 1, page 1:

> "A lifetrap is a pattern that starts in childhood and reverberates throughout life. It began with something that was _done_ to us by our families or by other children. We were abandoned, criticized, overprotected, abused, excluded, or deprived -- we were damaged in some way. Eventually the lifetrap becomes part of us. Long after we leave the home we grew up in, we continue to create situations in which we are mistreated, ignored, put down, or controlled in which we fail ot reach our most desired goals."

I would use my dillettante's knowledge of schema therapy as the events you're reading about would proceed to try and anticipate the base motivations and goals of the people coming after me. It was more clear as time passed that a manufactured lie of some sort was told about me and needed to be defended, especially given the connections as outlined by both my family and my employers to the federal government, but moreso the types of things I was going through would only be possible with someone very high up the federal government food chain.

Continuing from the book:

> "Lifetraps determine how we think, feel, act, and relate to others. The trigger strong feelings such as anger, sadness, and anxiety. Even when we _appear_ to have everything -- social status, an ideal marriage, the respect of people close to us, career success -- we are often unable to savor life or believe in our accomplishments."

In the social media era, it's rather easy to know quite a bit not only about someone's past, but also what makes them, well, triggered. It may not even be something about their past, but moreso what someone else said about them. Say, their timeline of awareness of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg's music, or, their drinking habits and preference towards wine coolers, and all online.

The future is now.

Reader, I'd reccomend, well, reading the above book if you're interested. The immediate effect ought to be self analysis, but, you more than likely will begin to analyze literally eveyrone you know.

It's a bad habit. I got over it a decade ago when I first read the book, though it took a few months of reminding myself to not be a prick. Doing CBT and mindfulness to better hear my own thoughts a decade ago really helped as well with that part.

But, I never stopped thinking about it intellectually because I also a decade ago wanted to escape my own life traps, which are only "schemas" of your identity if you let them be.

Here's Oxford's defintion of a "schema", by the way:

> 
> scheÂ·ma
> noun TECHNICAL
> a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model.
> "a schema of scientific reasoning"
> - LOGIC a syllogistic figure.
> - (in Kantian philosophy) a conception of what is common to all members of a class; a general or essential type or form.

That last one works really well against Object Oriented Programming, if you're familiar. But, I digress.

I think a lot about how most of society has not had therapy or taken it seriously the way I have. In June, former JAG Jesse Sommer would tell me he avoids therapy, despite the traumatic experiences he may have had or been exposed to while serving for a decade, specifically to avoid getting diagnosed.

I thought a lot about Jesse Sommer when I read the book a decade or so ago, about the time I knew him before he served almost two decades ago.

Lifetraps are probably a cheesy term, but they may be more appropriate than schemas, but I'm still hiding the book from plain sight.

...

In April, I'd learn about something I've heard about from my then therapist: DBT.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, separate though influenced by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, seems to have another system of dealing with complicated or "triggering" thoughts, albeit not one that counters CBT though in my dillettante's opinion, adds to it.

That said, the KHive DNC infiltrated my therapist through these events and I'm likely going to stay away from therapy until this situation can meet some resolution. I'm grateful I got to it well before as a result, and would encourage those not in my situation to seek therapy just as a way to explore yourself.

You don't need to be broken to be better.

But I digress. DBT, to me, as I was learning a bit about it in April, oddly seemed to somewhat represent the dialogue system in a video game I started playing that month as well: _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. Probably a coincidence, maybe not.

At any rate, DBT encourages you to see your brain as having two major "reflexive" response types to situations. I'm not certain on the correct terminology, but I remember it as "emotional" responses and "logical" responses.

DBT encourages you to ask what those persepectives are, then seek a third persepctive that incorporates both of those and helps decide the "best" decision: the wise mind.

Reader, the wise mind has nothing to do with the stereotypes you may or may have not heard about "wise guys", but that may not affect you as much as it does me.

I've often thought about this situation, and had I parsed it through DBT, how would I have reacted.

Given that I didn't think a private corporation like Netflix was involved, and it was most likely a government which has made a recent post 9/11 history of detaining at best and possibly torturing at worst brown civilians based on suspicions made of their race and their race alone?

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.

Emotionally, at the time: _I feel that my basic human rights were being violated by people who wanted to believe a fantasy over anything that could be proven as fact, in a way that insinuated it was personal, but with utilities that are explicitly usable against any human being, and I also feel kind of pissed off that I think they're doing it to "play" with technology they don't know about as much as I do, professionally speaking. But more directly: These motherfuckers do_ NOT _know me
and they really feel like they have to prove to someone that they do, and that makes me fucking angry._

Logicaly, I thought: _I need to worry about these people falsely incriminating me in order to validate their assumptions. There is either a financial motive in proving whatever they assumed about me, or there is a personal motive. Either way, I need to get ahead of them eventually falsely incriminating me as they've spent way too much money already and given the tech industry's involvement liekly are seeking some kind of return on their investment._

Like I said, I never did the DBT thing that much, due to the events outlined here, but that was how I was seeing it.

I kept coming to this conclusion that month when trying it and still do when trying to be "wise": _I'm pretty sure if I keep breadcrumbs of embrassment and nothing more, alongside not being a criminal in truth, I'm doing the wise mind thing. Just like, a human rights version. I really hope this story just goes away eventually as it likely was just a mistake due to financial mis motivations and hopefully not by someone too high up the Federal food chain, I really don't need credit, and as long as I keep not wanting fame out of this as my true intent, I should be fine. People in this country would not see me a Woodward or Bernstein but more of some weird Indian American Middle Aged version of Elian Gonzales probably, batshit people around here, I don't need that fame. But the worse they act, the more I have to escalate to draw attention to wider circles such to incur accountability and prevent them from falsely incrminating me._

And in the furthest reaches of my mind I thought: _Well, Kamala Harris is half Indian, surely if this was that crazy she'd never let this go so far..._

But then I remembered, even in the furthest reaches of my mind, VP Harris' history in California of famously locking up 3rd offenders aggressively alongside seeking convictions against marijuana offenders to the point of earning a reputation.

Then I remembered, in the furthest reaches of my mind, that India has twice the population of the European continent yet was under various European colonist rule for four centuries.

I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently.

...

I think the hardest thing about being someone who's engaged with so much therapy, and largely at their own will, is that it's caused me to grow past many people.

Maintaining those relationships, particularly with my family, has always been difficult.

My best interpretation is that these people wish for me to not be "past them," and would rather have me closer again.

However, the therapy caused me to grow in a way that recognized I wanted to be past them, and that leaves them with a tough choice:

_If the therapy made them better, and as a result it made them want to see things my way less, then is the therapy actually bad?_

It's a matter of perspective. Like I said, personally, it hurts the most with my family.

I think in 2022, I got caught up in another love affair, and bigger than just one my family could define.

It's hard to move on from some things, but yeah, I think the country could certainly do that, with a number of things, emotionally.

I just didn't think it needed to start with me and my family, personally, but, as the kids say "FML".

And that ends this first section of my personal History of Madness. The "F" doesn't actually stand for fuck.
