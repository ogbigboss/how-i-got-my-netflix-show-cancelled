Before joining Vouch I had two other job offers, with one at a public company called Liveramp. I reached out to see if their offer still stood, saying that Vouch wasn't a fit for me. They scheduled a meeting with me to discuss things the next Friday.

I had a bit of savings, the company would pay me a minor severance, and I wanted to use as much time as possible on just, well, myself and my own mental health. I hoped I could still get the job at Liveramp and start with something of a delay.

I looked at money and credit lines. I had wanted to spend 6 months at Vouch first, I had a plan to get my debt down to a certain level, and then my reward was supposed to be an OLED Television.

Amazon had a monthly installment plan. I said fuck it and ordered the TV along with a loveseat. I also ordered a new video card separately at Best Buy to boot, also on credit.

I spent the rest of the weekend smoking weed, playing videogames, and sleeping in.
