# Chapter 13 - Second Week post Vouch, 3/27/22

> [Michael narrating while being beaten by Fiona] It's unfortunate but true that no makeup can simulate blood and bruises well enough to stand up to close observation. So if your cover requires looking like you've been beaten... you have to get beaten.

I never thought I'd had to consider something like this, but by the end of the last week of March in 2022, I was having this thought:

_Would the government perceive my suicidality as an attempt to cover something up?_

I didn't think much of it, given my next thought:

_Even if they did, they'd likely switch back to an investigation that doesn't involve my employers and just watches me using normative creep tactics like... watching and not reacting. I'm not doing crimes so that's fine by me, if a little weird, but I can accept that if the value is that these people don't do thsi stupid shit again._

Furthermore:

_It's not like I'm going stop therapy on my own accord anytime soon, so let's just all watch me discuss my family issues, I can't imagine they'd go further than that - just watching me not commit crimes and repair my psyche. That's not illegal. I am going to have to lie to my therapist a bit though, that kind of sucks._

Reader, had I known the spectre of Netflix fame was motivating the government, and not just a hopeful political smear to move someone up the chain of command of whatever they belonged to, I might've asked myself a third question:

_What if a normal investigation where it's just the government and not the government, my employers, and my family weren't enough in terms of the motivations of whomever wanted this?_

But even as I imagined the literal VP Kamala Harris wanting to crucify me for a political opportunity, I still couldn't imagine how taking a risk on a second investigation with a second employer would be worth it.

At the time it was also way too outlandish to take seriously. She's the Vice President of the United States. I'm a 36 year old loser who lives alone and is in 6 figure debt due to entrepreunerial ambitions and/or "failures."

I'd doubt she really would need to prove something about me that the above sentence wouldn't suffice.

Reader, I don't watch much reality TV, and I don't think I'd ever throw my career away to get on one of those or any TV show. I am, however, probably throwing my career away to get one of those shows cancelled, for the better of my country's history and reputation, if not just myself.

But that's me in 2023. Let's get back to 2022.
