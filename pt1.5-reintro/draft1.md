# Pt 1.5 -- A flash to the future

### Mid afternoon near the end of the workday in a conference call with around 8 people on Friday, May 20 2022

This was the first time in this situation where I was so shocked I developed tunnel vision.

_I... are.. they... grimacing?_

Friday afternoons offer most workplace teams the chance to blow off a little steam with some polite conversation about, say, the weekend, or the less than pro forma parts of the job, like differences in laptop CPUs and more (I'm a programmer working in tech with other programmers, talking about CPUs for fun isn't weird ok).

_Are... they... responding... to what I said...?_

It was my second week in the job, and, things seemed suspicious yet again even before I started this job.

_Did... they... remove their hair tie on purpose...?_

Given my suspicions started before the new job did, and this was after the Vouch fiasco, if you read the previous part you'd be safe to assume I was running `the_gg_move` as often as I could muster, which meant most any meeting with 5+ people where I could politely turn my camera and mic off without fear of feeling socially awkward.

Maybe it's the lack of that fear that causes me to act, but, in previous cases, if no one responds, I get to stop acting, and I know that the "mute" button means just that - if it's honest, I can be too.

_Are... they... wait... did someone tell them to do that...?_

That said, `the_gg_move` is an act, a lie, so, sometimes I say things that are lies to purposefully cajole people. Not always though.

At one point in this afternoon meeting, with around 8 or so people in it, the entire small team I was working with if I recall, someone brought up their laptop being old. I started talking to myself in response, with my mic on mute and camera off:

> "Well, I gotta say this laptop they gave me is really nice, spec wise. Gonna be a shame when I return it after quitting."

My coworker seemed to flinch, in concern. At that point something clicked -

_So they were given audio surveillance on me, they're younger than me, they're supposed to be my coworker, they're not even my boss, they share the same title as me, and they get to audio surveil me. And for some reason, they would be concerned if I were to quit._

I realized that technically, I was an asset - I'm a very good programmer, and a good team mate to boot. I'm good at what I'm hired to do, when I'm given a chance to do it.

But maybe more importantly -

_People only get concerned if there's something to lose. I'm not the only asset. Someone is selling this audio surveillance software to big tech companies, and likely at a unit level. Otherwise my coworker and HR people at Vouch wouldn't be introduced to what is essentially spycraft. I'm in a sales pitch._

Or, at least I thought at the time.

My coworker was a woman with blonde hair. I do know that many with blonde hair identify as not having hair that is a certain color, but being of an identity known as "blonde." What I said next was to try and trigger, and yes, maybe "cyber bully" the person who flinched in response to something they could only have heard via audio surveillance, as the rest of the team was joking.

If I was wrong, she certainly wouldn't have reacted further.

> "Ah... I see I don't have to worry about HR, what I have to worry about is hair dye."

Reader, I'm 75% certain I said "hair dye" and not "blonde hair dye", as I'm ok with all colors in the skittles rainbow, not just yellow. But she was blonde and I may have said just that.

_Is... she... she's... flipping her hair at me while grimacing?_

My coworker seemed to double down by removing her hair tie, fixing her face in disgust, staring right at the camera and flipping her hair somewhat violently forward with her hands in a gesture that I had to feel was more of a communication than a styling attempt given she had to fix her hair afterwards, and seemed _angry_ about it.

I mean, maybe I'm wrong. I just remember not looking at anyone else, even though she was in a small window given that seh wasn't the current speaker and thinking:

_Did she do that on her own? Or did someone tell her to do that?_

Look, `the_gg_move` is not exactly a way to make friends.

It's a way to figure out to what extent you're being audio surveilled by your boss.

And, apparently, your younger co workers of the opposite gender.
