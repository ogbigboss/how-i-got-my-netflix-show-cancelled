# Chapter 6 - Third Week at Vouch, 3/2 on

> "You ever meet someone, and it just seems to click instantly? You like the same things, share the same opinions - it seems lke you've known them your whole life. It could be fate, or it could be that you have a listening device planted under the dashbaord of your car." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Wednesday at work was fairly normal. I had code to look at, so I looked. There were some other meetings that didn't feel too weird.

However, in my apartment in New York City, on the edge of the East River, and a street away from the FDR underpass, something strange started happening.

The underpass below the FDR, directly across the street from me and the easiest thing to view that's not the river itself once you exit the building, has three sections. On the left is the FDNY section, which is used primarily for EMS vehicles. During the 2020 COVID lockdown, it was busy moving the sick and the dead. On the right is a DSNY section, which also I believe houses a maintanence crew for city vehicles in general, but mostly sanitation cars moved in that area.

In the middle was an unmarked area. Later in 2020 during the George Floyd protests, this area was flooded with unmarked vans. I'm pretty sure it's for the cops.

About 6 or 7 years ago, it was empty under there. You could even park if you had a car and nothing would be there to stop you.

In 2022, starting to my recollection on March 2nd 2022, I started to see something that became a regular theme over the next few weeks and into the spring: rental cars, primarily but not entirely focused on parking in the "middle" section.

I've seen cop cars park there, sometimes. Unmarked vehicles, often. But rental cars have a... "I was just cleaned" look to them.

I sighed and figure'd that last night's research couldn't have been too far off: _only out of towners would rent cars, and only law enforcement should be able to park in that area, and only out of town law enforcement would focus on renting mostly black, american vehicles given domestic discounts._

And, if I was wrong, well, then nothing else weird would happen.

...

Thursday, the new guy whom I had shared words with though we never spoke, shared his bio with the rest of the company, as did all the other new employees that week.

Almost magically, he would fill out the rest of the band I'm not in - he played drums and bass. Wow. I play guitar and sing! And we're both brown guys!

... did they think we'd be friends?

Under more normal circumstances, I may have reached out and said something. But he wasn't in my department, nor a programmer of any kind, so we had no real context to talk about those things, though I had with other employees in my department.

Normally I wouldn't pay attention to any of that being a sign of subterfuge _just because the guy's brown skinned and I am to_... but I did begin to wonder if the CEO flinched as hard as he did because yes, the guy was hired here to try and "feel me out."

I forget his name, but weeks later I would look him up on linked in as well. Apparently, he went to college with the company's head of security, a young man named Cody who was hired shortly before I was and seemed to have a background in "digital security." I also noted the new guy's resume had little to say about business insurance, and seemed fairly entry level.

Did the newly hired digital security guy ask his one college buddy to join a company and play up a musical inclination to... feel me out?

It'd be weird if so.

But I've also never seen a CEO with such a stellar reputation flinch as hard at anything as I saw Hodges flinch two days ago.

It's probably just a coicidence.

...

March is, of course, women's history month, and Vouch was not going to let that one slide. On Thursday, there was an optional meeting that, had I more work to do, I probably would have politely tried to avoid, focused on celebrating the month.

I've come a long way with regards to the whole "politics at work" thing -- yes, I wish communicating to people about my politics caused effective change, but I think we really tried that a bit too much with the social media and we should all dial back a bit ~~before we go insane as a society in such a way that normal people like me feel like we're in a zombie movie where we can't just behead our problems away due to the zombie class' elevated police state~~, but that's just my opinion.

I also hate meetings, and feel that all too often, people work past the hour when they should be going home.

Less bullshit, less meetings, more going home on time and a trend towards workplace efficieny over emoji likes would be nice, but again, I'm at a tech startup.

I go to the meeting. I don't want to appear sexist, certainly not in this situation. I keep my camera on and my mic as well, I doubt I said anything though I certainly had some thoughts.

There was a light presentation given by an HR person enthusiastically describing the Stonewall Riot, commemorating a 1969 conflict in NYC between the cops and the LGBTQ+ members of the community at a bar. Very progressive for a company on women's history month, though, I do wonder how a business insurance company would actually react to broken windows and situations involving police riots, despite the politics.

At some point the larger meeting, which had 40 or so people, was broken up into smaller "breakout" sessions, where about 5 or so would gather to have a more close knit conversation.

A white woman with dyed black curly hair in her late 40s was in my group. She seemed nice, and I can't remember the exact topic of our breakout -- I'd imagine it had to do with women, being a meeting on women's history month. For some reason, this woman, in response to something completely unconnected, brought up the Sandanistas a few times. Perhaps she was Nicaraguan, though I can't remember, I just remember thinking _how in gods name did you find a segway to bring up the Sandanistas at a women's history month meeting?_

I sighed. I remembered that, if you did a "background check" on me past the usual information, you might find I tried to start a game project which did involve, yes, people who call themselves words that get grouped into a political grouping that yes, may include the Sandanistas.

Does that mean that's my politics? I don't even agree with political groupings. Like I said I think you nutbags are all zombies. What's that? I didn't say that? Hmm.

Anyway, that someone may be "checking me out" for "latent signs of" the "notion to speak on radical politics in the work place" -- I'm at a point in my life where I regret going to work on election days, just to avoid conversation. It took me awhile, like I said. So I wasn't worried.

But, a thought: _Jesus christ, every C level being aware I get, an HR person in their 20s is kind of unprofessional, but who is this random white woman who seems super interested in proving that Rachel Maddow was right about me all along, even though Ms. Maddow and I don't know each other?_

If you haven't picked up by now, I have a figurative thought process.

I'm polite, and try and get out of that meeting saying as little as I can while keeping the camera on and the mic off mute.

...

Later in the day and after the diversity meeting, I see a chat room focused on women's history month. I take a look but I don't join, not wanting to stir anything up.

Many have spoken on the month -- most of the women in the company, and all of the c levels. There's a lot of chat to scroll through.

A new C level, Rukmini Banerjee, seemed to be making her presence known by setting up a prompt:

> "For women's history month, I thought it'd be great if we could all name a woman we find influential."

Or something to that extent. Rukmini had just joined around when I had, and I hadn't seen her in any all hands meetings. Perhaps I would have, had I not quit.

Dozens of responses included photos and links, references to women of note, women in people's families, and women of note in people's families.

I recall seeing the CEO refer to his grandmother, whom was a scientist.

I almost lost my shit when I saw John Wallace, the CIO, and what he had typed. I had already noticed in another google doc he seemed to have trouble with his spelling and grammar. That's fine - we all do here and there - but it's atypical for a C level who is a native to an english speaking country, and I had seen quite a few lapses on his part already. But, given the prompt, and the setting, I was pretty suprised to see him start a sentence thusly:

> "It's hard not to lose at so many woman, but if I had to choose..."

He went on to discuss his mother, who was a diver, and the time she dove while wearing all her clothes at a party.

Now, the... way one could read into the phrasing is a subject I'll leave up to you reader, that isn't nearly as important as simply recognizing that, yes, that is a sentence that one doesn't just read, they read _into_ it.

It's just funny that, seeing as how hours past and dozens of people contributed underneath that message, CIO Wallace would've had the opportunity to, well, edit it. It's obvious he meant "it's hard to lose given so many great women out there", or some such shit, and if he edited it, that's what it woudl say, and only whoever read it the first time would ever have to think about the word "projection."

It also meant that no one on the C level, nor any of his subordinates were willing to or could convince him, in a separate DM, to change the sentence, for the obvious implications that it seems he's saying women are a thing to compete over, along with the singular where there should be a plural issue.

Or, he's just not the kind of guy that wants to be known for editing his mis phrasings.

I felt, weird about it, but moved on. I had that earlier feeling that he may be a dork ass loser, and I think I was right.

...

I have another 1:1 with a developer, this time outside of my team but within my department. She was younger than I, seemed very smart, we got along quickly with regards to technical things. At one point, I asked her a question with regards to the database they were using. For those that are technical, I asked if the company considered using NoSQL at some point, even in the format of a Json column, in order to deal with different "versions" of insurance plans that may be dynamic in structure between various clients. They seemed to be undergoing a project that woudl take a lot of work via individual migrations where versioning documents may make more sense and serve as a better parallel for insurance clients -- but this was in my opinion.

She seemed a bit taken aback and commented that she had made the same suggestion but was brushed off.

Now, I don't know the full technical details -- this was a "rails" backend, and often, rails developers want to stick to idioms that are more structured than NoSQL. Pardon the tech jargon - that's just to say she and I could have both been wrong but, given the way she let me know, I began to wonder, against all the other things I had experienced, whether Vouch was a company dealing with internal bigotry more than it's CEO, a former Obama apointee, might want to be known for.

It'd make a lot of sense considering I thoguht I was under investigation for crimes I hadn't committed nor really existed such that at least _someone else_ did the stuff they were investigating me for. I mean, maybe, but they never todl me why they were investigating me, if they were. Anyway.

It's just to say, I could misread her and projected my own thoughts. But I kept them to myself and replied by saying that maybe the datbase thing had somethign to do with resource management or scheduling, and, it probably did.

...

Friday came and wasn't terribly eventful. However, looking out my window, I kept seeing a rotation of rental cars. There seemed to be more and more. Some even seemed to bulge a bit. It's obvious I've watched a lot of _Burn Notice_, but sometimes armoring a car woudl mean putting things "under" the normal areas such that they jut out a bit. I could have been seeing things but then I started to ask myself...

If this was the FBI, they wouldn't rent cars -- they have a field office in Manhattan at least. Neither would the NYPD.

The CIA doesn't technically have jurisdiction Stateside. Sort of, but this probably wasn't a them thing. The DHS seemed unlikely as well.

I think I looked up at that moment to be sure of something I wasn't 100% on: technically speaking, who does the digital crimes thing, federally at least?

There wasn't a clear answer, but one of them was the Secret Service, but moreso, it really could've been... well... all of them. But the Secret Service would probably be the DC oriented folks that have the most connections with the NYPD, explaining the rental cars as well as the location.

Like I said before, I have a figurative brain, and it flashed for a second.

In programming, a linked list is a set of data structures where one links to another.

A thought process can feel like one at times, if you hear all your thoughts.

> OK. So this could be the White House.
>
> OK. So my boss' boss' boss used to, in some way, work for a former White House admin.
>
> OK. So my sister may have gone to college with my boss' boss' boss.
>
> OK. So my sister works in a federal court in California and lives in Los Angeles.
>
> OK. Wait, this could be the White House? Which one?
>
> Oh. The White House admin with a VP who used to represent California, where your sister lives.
>
> Oh. The White House admin with a VP who is half the nationality you and your sister are.
>
> Oh. The White House admin that is pushing DEI, and your sister is a DEI officer
>
> Oh. Oh. Oh.
>
> Well, my sister had political ambitions, maybe, but moreso she had ambitions as an actor. As long as this isn't some Netflix show, maybe Ill be fine.

Your brain can think some crazy things. You can't prove them for truth. I remember thinking the above and thinking, man, that'd be crazy. And fucked up. And it'd only be true if, well, somehow this thing continues in a way to prove that those connections matter more than the law which was being utilized to investigate me.

But, given it was DC, I'd probably never be able to prove it. Well, not alone at least.
