# Pt 1 Ch 7 - Fifth Week at Vouch, 3/6/22 -- Eyes in the back of my mind

### Draft

> "You'd be surprised how often covert operatives pose as international men of mystery. Fantasies about glamarous covert ops can be extremely useful to exploit. Though, some secret agent fantasies are more useful than others." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from USA Network's _Burn Notice_

I honestly wasn't sure what was more dissapointing with Vouch: that they had "woopsie-daisied" their way into putting me under what felt like a federal investigation of some sort, or that they told half the damn company that I was under some kind of investigation like it was gossip, and asked them to try and "trigger" me in meetings to see how I'd respond to things like the "Sandanistas."

I supposed I'd have to deal with the latter more than the former, though that changed this week.

*introduce Razzlekhan incident, describe how Netflix was in town for it working with the feds, unbenknownst to you*

...

That week I skipped the company all hand's on purpose. I felt I had caused too much a scene between that and the other meeting the previous week. A few hours before, I told my manager I'd be absent in the afternoon, making up the excuse of a doctor's appointment. Outside of meetings, I said to my laptop outloud:

> "Look, I think we can all use a break. I'm going for a walk during the meeting, I'll be back online in the afternoon."

No point in lying to people surveilling you about a doctor's appointment that doesn't exist after all.

I, like many, feel safer when I have some amount of cash with me. I, at the time, had little to none, so I made a plan to take a long winding walk to the ATM, something that's normal to me. I work at a computer usually, so I need to find ways to move around here and there.

In the introdution of this memoir, I speak of an incident that would happen in the future with regards to feeling followed as well as setup.

That day was my first of getting used to such feelings, but even in comparison, it felt more childish in ways.

On my walk, I could identify three groups of people, with two different groups of behaviors.

Behaviors:
1. Setting up in positions ahead of where I was going -- I walk slowly, this is easier done than said in a city like New York given a handful of folks and surveillance equipment -- such to "eye me", maybe to see if they recognized me or something.
1. Trying to get my attention sexually -- generally this was women but one man acted peculiarly in a way I usually identiy as someone trying to get me to check them out. Hey, it happens, but I'm not that good looking, and that day especially, I was less so. It also wasn't a nice day -- it was just about 55' but very gray, warm for March maybe, and some people were wearing nice outfits, but many of the ladies I saw were wearing clothes that wouldn't make sense for mid week in a not that touristy section of downtown.

Groups of people:
1. One group felt like undercover NYPD -- they had clothes that looked more worn than not
1. Another group felt like undercover Feds of various sorts -- they had clothes that were recently bought, and some of them dressed younger than their ages, likely on purpose for the occasion
1. The final group felt like Federal "hackers" asked to see if they recognized me -- they looked like typical computer nerds, save for the fact that when I made them, it appeared like they'd glance around for their security person, one of the above at times.

I made a dropbox video where I record myself using google maps and describing each othe locations where I felt suspicious of osmeone, describing their outfits and cadences. I'm going to avoid being so exhaustive here and just speak on the most interesting chain of events; as I was walking home.

*describe Catherine (nts: check notes and map) street incident. Three young women dart in front of you, one guy oggles them comically like he's a older light skinned hispanic peppe le peu, one of the young woman eyes you while they walk into a coffee shop across the street, you avoid, then a block later some dude is doign the walk straight guys do to imitate gay guys; I then iamgine they were trying to figure out my sexuality. if I didn't follow the women, then surely i'd follow the dude flexing his ass. Describe walking faster, butt checks responds by running away.*

*end with hitting South st and seeing the guy in the Benzo with the track suit eye you real hard and start to wonder if they think they can "entrap" me based on my claim that they were the "mob" and they were too stupid to realize I was giving the government a way out of this situation without me accusing them of "the truth" - alas, this was over a year ago*

...

*after describing immaturity in above "investigation", retrospectively put together that the best explanation is that whoever was doing the above was part of a television show more than a normative intelligence operation. I, at the time, just thought they were being cruel for sport.*
