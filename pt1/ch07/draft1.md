# Pt 1 Ch 7 -- Eyes in the back of my mind

> "You'd be surprised how often covert operatives pose as international men of mystery. Fantasies about glamarous covert ops can be extremely useful to exploit. Though, some secret agent fantasies are more useful than others." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from USA Network's _Burn Notice_

I honestly wasn't sure what was more dissapointing with Vouch: that they had "woopsie-daisied" their way into putting me under what felt like a federal investigation of some sort, or that they told half the damn company that I was under some kind of investigation like it was gossip, and asked them to try and "trigger" me in meetings to see how I'd respond to things like the "Sandanistas."

I suppose I thought I'd have to deal with the latter more than the former, though that changed this week.
