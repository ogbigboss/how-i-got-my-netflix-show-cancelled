# Pt 1 Ch 7 - Fifth Week at Vouch, 3/6/22 -- Eyes in the back of my mind

### Draft

> "You'd be surprised how often covert operatives pose as international men of mystery. Fantasies about glamarous covert ops can be extremely useful to exploit. Though, some secret agent fantasies are more useful than others." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from USA Network's _Burn Notice_

I honestly wasn't sure what was more dissapointing with Vouch: that they had "woopsie-daisied" their way into putting me under what felt like a federal investigation of some sort, or that they told half the damn company that I was under some kind of investigation like it was gossip, and asked them to try and "trigger" me in meetings to see how I'd respond to things like the "Sandanistas."

I supposed I'd have to deal with the latter more than the former, though that changed this week.

...

That week I skipped the company all hand's on purpose. I felt I had caused too much a scene between that and the other meeting the previous week. A few hours before, I told my manager I'd be absent in the afternoon, making up the excuse of a doctor's appointment. Outside of meetings, I said to my laptop outloud:

> "Look, I think we can all use a break. I'm going for a walk during the meeting, I'll be back online in the afternoon."

No point in lying to people surveilling you about a doctor's appointment that doesn't exist after all.

I, like many, feel safer when I have some amount of cash with me. I, at the time, had little to none, so I made a plan to take a long winding walk to the ATM, something that's normal to me. I work at a computer usually, so I need to find ways to move around here and there.

In the introdution of this memoir, I speak of an incident that would happen in the future with regards to feeling followed as well as setup.

That day was my first of getting used to such feelings, but even in comparison, it felt more childish in ways.

On my walk, I could identify three groups of people, with two different groups of behaviors.

Behaviors:
1. Setting up in positions ahead of where I was going -- I walk slowly, this is easier done than said in a city like New York given a handful of folks and surveillance equipment -- such to "eye me", maybe to see if they recognized me or something.
1. Trying to get my attention sexually -- generally this was women but one man acted peculiarly in a way I usually identiy as someone trying to get me to check them out. Hey, it happens, but I'm not that good looking, and that day especially, I was less so. It also wasn't a nice day -- it was just about 55' but very gray, warm for March maybe, and some people were wearing nice outfits, but many of the ladies I saw were wearing clothes that wouldn't make sense for mid week in a not that touristy section of downtown.

Groups of people:
1. One group felt like undercover NYPD -- they had clothes that looked more worn than not
1. Another group felt like undercover Feds of various sorts -- they had clothes that were recently bought, and some of them dressed younger than their ages, likely on purpose for the occasion
1. The final group felt like Federal "hackers" asked to see if they recognized me -- they looked like typical computer nerds, save for the fact that when I made them, it appeared like they'd glance around for their security person, one of the above at times.

I made a dropbox video where I record myself using google maps and describing each othe locations where I felt suspicious of osmeone, describing their outfits and cadences. I'm going to avoid being so exhaustive here and just speak on the most interesting chain of events; as I was walking home.

I should be clear: were all this to happen and none of the previous events, particularly the vehicles I'd never seen before start parking across the street, well, I'd probably just assume I was looking good, or maybe walking with good posture or, just, had it going on for some reason in a drab outfit, unshowered, with my hair in many places at once, shaven as though I wanted someone from the early aughts to pop out of a time machine and accuse me of terrorism based on my unkempt beard.

I mean, it's happened before, sometimes people are into that sort of thing.

But on that day, when I felt numerous accounts of those behaviors, I felt certain of the groupings being more possible as well.

...

I could be wrong, but when I want to I have a great memory, so I made sure to remember as much as I could, taking the time to walk indirectly, zig zag across the street, speed up, slow down, and make as many excuses to gather my surroundings as possible.

I really don't know how that came off to everyone watching me. Maybe I should have thought about that a bit more.

Either way, I eventually come to a tight street in Chinatown on my way home. As I'm crossing, I see to my left a group of 3 young women crossing perpendiculurly in my direction, such that if I kept at the same pace, I'd likely collide. I didn't feel like slowing down, so I sped up instead and looked downwards, cutting off my peripheral vision in a way most other pedestrians might notice as I come into their vision, forcing them to slow down if and only if I haven't sped up enough. You can call it a bit rude if you want. I learned it walking around Chinatown and seeing old people do it, so I don't care.

I never said I was a role model.

The downside of cutting off your peripherals by looking down is you also can't see ahead of you; the three young woman must have sped up, and I assume specifically to be ahead of me or get betwixt me. I slow down in response and allow them to move forward with their new pace; they turn the corner so they are now in front of me instead of crossing. I'm not sure at that point if they're involved in my situation, but I'm wary of the three young women who are dressed like tourists or perhaps college students in the way most would be given the above.

As they walk further down the street, I see an older hispanic man sweeping outside a storefront with a broom, and he makes the time to near comically bug his eyes out at the three young girls such that, well, anyone like me some 20-30 ft away could see he thought those three young girls were worth becoming a human Warner Bros. cartoon over.

I may be getting ahead of myself on that last one, but I digress.

The young ladies cross the street shortly after the broom sweeper turns his head to see them pass. As they do, one looks back and takes the time to make eye contact with me. If it weren't for the broom guy, I might've felt flattered.

_I think they want me to follow them into some store, to start a conversation of some sort, likely for the reasons of general entrapment. It's not even that I'm aware of that -- I just don't want to follow three strange people into a store just to start a conversation because they looked at me._

Either way -- wether I was aware of being under a bogus Federal Investigation gone wrong or not -- reader, I would not have walked into that store for the reasons above. It's just not a me thing to do. What am I gonna say? "Hey, I was following you and you looked entertaining so now we're here. Hi!" Maybe it works for other people, but it's just not a very me thing.

I did something I may not have done had I not been paranoid about my workplace fooling with the government to make fools of themselves -- I sighed. Then I did the normal thing and kept walking.

I cross further down the block and I see a man ahead of me on the same side, about 25 feet ahead. He's a bit taller than me and athletic, wearing a light shade of pants. I noticed him because he was walking the way people walk to caricature gay men. I assume he was straight as a result, but that's not what I was thinking.

_Oh. These weirdos want to figure out my sexuality. They're wondering why I didn't follow the three young girls into a store and they took the time to plan that one, maybe. This is a quick decision made in light of that, and kind of childish at that. I can imagine a lot of people on headphones watching cameras in vans like this was a TV show, or kind of like Chris Penn rest in peace and Tom Sizemore's characters_ -- this thought was prior to his passing so rest in peace as well and best wishes to both Penn and Sizemore's families -- _in one of my favorite movies_ True Romance _well, I'd rather the cops or whomeever have fun with this. It would be easier to gain their sympathies that way to make sure I don't get framed later on, even if this is kind of immature in my opinion._

That said, another thought came into my head:

_But I could be wrong. How could I prove that I wasn't?_

I figure'd if this guy was doing this on behalf of an investigation, and he had support, and was trying to figure out if I was comically gay instead of comically straight, then a lot of people are watching.

So I deliberately picked up my pace. In my head, I made a plan to run past him to see what would happen.

I put my first foot down with a slightly higher pace. My second foot is in the air and his asscheecks all of a sudden drop a similar distance from their position of... whatever he was doing to however he would normally walk.

I continue to walk faster and he picks up his pace just a bit, glancing to his right at I presume a rear view mirror.

Just a few more steps before I could break out into a jog, a man I mostly call "buttcheeks" in my head does one of the coolest things I think I've ever seen.

To this day, it was probably the coolest thing any of these clowns pulled off.

As a white van comes down the street to my right, buttcheeks darts in front of it. It cuts of my vision as I assume he ran across the street.

I never even got to a jog -- after barely a few steps at a higher pace, the van passed, and I looked down the corner and across the street --

No sign of buttcheeks.

He couldn't of gotten in the van; it was moving too fast. I honestly don't know where he went.

So when I say I think of a man who was likely an undercover NYPD based on the wear in his clothing as "buttcheeks" -- don't you dare say I think less of him for it.

...

As I got home I crossed South St. for little reason other than to check out the water a bit before going home. I was taking a break from work, after all.

A shiny clean, boxy, older style Mercedes Benz sedan pulls up as I cross. I have the light so I'm not worried but it makes a quick move to meet me on the street; without the light, and maybe in another part of the city, I may have stopped.

In these moments, I like to give a light "look" to the driver so they know it's probably not the best place to do that; without saying any words. Sometimes out of towners pull off the FDR and think it's still Jersey, it happens.

That said, the shiny Benz has a driver that seems equally willing to give me a look; even if it's more of a lean-past-the-wheel-because-Im-older-and-itd-be-easier-to-see-you-closely kind of look.

I'm 37; sometimes I gotta do it too, but the guy was in his 50s. To me his haircut screamed Fed, but his loose fitting track outfit screamed TV mob guy; especially with the Benz.

Again, I wouldn't have considered him anything other than an oddity of culture -- being a brown guy who grew up in Jersey then lived in New York makes me one in some ways -- but given how funny the walk felt otherwise, I remember I had the thought:

_Wait are these people stupid enough to think that I really thought it was the mob and now they're dressing up to see how I'd react to something like that? How much TV do they watch? Does the NSA really not know I haven't even seen the Godfather series yet? What kind of fascism is this?_

Also another thought:

_My tax dollars deserve better than this. Maybe even other people's too._


...

One thing I hadn't thought about was Cryptocurrency. Other than working for a single company in athat industry in a career that's seen employ at dozens of other non Crypto firms, it wasn't really a big part of my life.

I've had regrets. Many of us have. I could have been a millionaire etc.

Over a decade ago I gave my buddy some cash that he turned into Crypto ~~so he could buy acid~~ but we liquidated it too quickly to see it as investment.

That said I've never spent one US Penny of mine on a Crypto currency, and I'll keep that at that.

It's a very popular thing to do these days, however.

A month before, on February 8th, 2022, the US Justice Department arrested a couple for laundering money via crypto currency, seizing more than $3.5 billion in assets along the way, the largest financial seizure ever.

On February 12th, 2022, Netflix ordered a docuseries on the couple.

I share nothing in common wiht that couple, save for a few things:

1. They were living blocks away from where I lived and worked in the financial district at the time.
1. I think I'm funnier but yes one of them has put out content under the identity "Razzlekhan," referring to herself as the "Crocodile of Wall st", and is a, well, "character", like I am aware I can be.
1. Razzlekhan is a musician and puts out music under that name, as well, I was just hoping to maybe do with a guitar and some like 90s cover songs, a totally different style if you ask me, but whatever

Reader, in 2023, I'm pretty sure we were both under a federal investigation due to the fact that I share the three things above, this has been revealed via audio surveillance to my company whom unbenknownst to me may have connections with the federal government, who is more than likely being interviewed right that moment by Netflix for the Razzlekahn thing.

But I have never, not once, spent a dime on crypto currency. I've never committed financial fraud.

I'm not a criminal.

But I am a kooky person.

_What kind of fascism is this?_ is a thought I frequently have; though, I wouldn't google for the keywords "netflix cryptocurrency series" until about December that year of 2022, when 9 months later I finally realized I needed more answers than these people apparently needed to leave my life.

Either way, had I known society's true crime fascination was overlapping with a digital fraud case of historic proportions that centered around the social media habits of the criminal, well, I probably wouldn't have acted the way I did.

But, I was acting. When Razzlekhan committed crimes they weren't, and that will always be the difference between them and me.

But we are both kooky people.

_What kind of fascism is this?_
