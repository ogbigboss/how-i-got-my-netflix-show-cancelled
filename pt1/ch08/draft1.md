> Oleg: You're real Michael Westen, yes?
>
> Michael: Yeah.

> Oleg: Back home, your story Russian Intelligence tells to scare. They say you're one name for many people. Special Operations team. They think one person cannot make so much problems.
>
> Michael: Nope. Just me.

*open with section retrospectively, from 2023, outlining the Biden / Harris' admin, perhaps at an appointee's level, likely fascination with crucifying me for political purposes* *see notes in folder for details*

...

*go back to getting back home from the walk, talk about the rest of that day, communicating to whomever was listening that you were well aware of what just took place and what it meant*

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, seeing if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*
