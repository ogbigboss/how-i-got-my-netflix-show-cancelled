*open with section retrospectively, from 2023, outlining the Biden / Harris' admin, perhaps at an appointee's level, likely fascination with crucifying me for political purposes* *see notes in folder for details*

Reader, I write this in 2023 facing criminal charges brought up in the context of me spending my late 2022 and early 2023 making a series of dropbox videos in the style of a "confessional" outlining these events. I did this largely as a way to clear my name should anyone try and smear it; had the parties I felt were harassing me simply left or provided evidence they were stopping their behaviors, I would have stopped making the videos, and if they can at some point, I could even disavow them. But until then, I'm pretty certain my current situation is not necessarily because of what happened at Vouch, but what's happening to this country: _partisan division over practical politics_. Over social media, no less.

Now, in 2023, I may be facing time or at least a life of always being labeled a criminal simply for trying to make a publicly accessible video recording of not my proof of anything in fact; but what remains a fiction until proven true: my story. All I know is that I was acting, and talking about acting, and acting while talking about acting - but on my own recording devices, not their's.

This has, clearly, and perhaps unfortunately, all been a big joke to me. Haven't you been reading? Not everyone finds me funny, sad but true.

Yes, the charges literally have to do with the video series. And yes, I'm writing this memoir literally as a way to keep my name clear before anything more can happen to me while confined or otherwise.

But that's 2023. Let's get back to early March 2022.

...

*go back to getting back home from the walk, talk about the rest of that day, communicating to whomever was listening that you were well aware of what just took place and what it meant*

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, seeing if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
