# Chapter 8 - Fifth week at Vouch post being followed

### Outline

1. Retrospectively describe the Biden / Harris' admin's political motivations against you at the time, given your recent attempt to make a video game with many Sanders supporters over social media. Describe the Khive vs Sanders social media wars that you largely stayed out of and consider to be a fringe fascination compared to most actual voter interest. Hwoever you largely left that project due to feeling like everyone's brains were broken from social media, politicians included, and yes on "all sides". In retrospect, possibly even before joining Vouch due to the Razzlekhan investigation on the part of a Biden Harris appointed DOJ, I was picked to be a "revenge" project -- I just had to be a criminal, and it would've been perfect for the DNC Biden / Harris' admin's upcoming potential primaries the next year. It would've launched in time for it even!
1. Don't forget to point out Hastings was the CEO at the time and a large donor to the Democrats without balancing donations in a similar weight to republicans (nts: check on google, pretty sure)
1. Introduce _The Promised Land_ project a bit more, focus on how you at the very least created a private DM group tp be the "board" of a charitable video game organization that included many figures involved in the above "social media wars" that you never really played a part in or earned the celebrity of the people on the board
1. The above made you guilty be association the Biden / Harris admin, and many of their appointees, who likely saught to "crucify" me as not only a Bernie Bro, but a criminal, for various political reasons.
1. Also mention Obama's book _A Promised Land_, and your at the time musing that he may be trying to out do you, or think I was making some weirdo lefty play for Bruce Springsteen via a biblical reference, and wondering what hsi title had to do with the content of the book in question, given said reference. Mention that in 2020 you thought it was weird, but while taking a shit reading the news on an ipad that thought comes up a lot, so I didn't think about it much then, as if he thought I belonged to "the social media left" he was mistaken - I belong to no one. But yeah it was too weird of a coincidence to take seriously back then and I didn't think about it again until the Vouch situation, albeit in the back of my mind. Stop writing copy in notes.
1. This also heavily explains why Eloise was so fortright about her own marriage and the company's sexual harrassment issues - they asked her to do so hoping I would react sexistly to better fit their framing of "bernie Bro" stereotypes -- this is a theme that HEAVILY played into my previous year -- make that clear ot th ereader, break the flow of time etc
1. Finally end with this explaining why they were so interested in your opinions on Russia - if I could be a bernie bro, I'm a sexist, if I could be a criminal, then bernie bros are sexists and criminals -- but if I could be a bernie bro who is a crinal AND working for Vladimir Putin? That would be the most ideal outcome. Discuss working in tech and how speculative outcomes are the bread and butter of VC management, and that this overlap likely caused the Biden / Harris admin to act specutively as opposed to withint he bounds of the law, and since the Vouch incident have been attempting to justify their crimes against a US citizen or smear that citizen from speaking their truth, all via Netflix
1. Ok, maybe make this just a separate chapter. After all. In that case, end with a look towards the future, particularly the Biden / Harris' admin's failure to despite a senate majority secure American citizen's right to abortion. My suspicion since has been that I somehow have become a big enough political distraction that they forgot to make sure their Senate body was in line, or possibly offended them by spending so much time on this.
1. Add the point that the Democrats also likely confused and obfuscated the nascent Crypto Currency's ability to regulate itself properly, and foreshadow FTX / Crytpo liqudity issues as well.
1. Be brief about the last two points because they happen in the future, to the time of the story.
1. Talk about charges.
