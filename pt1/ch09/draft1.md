# Pt 1 Ch 9 - Back to my fifth week at Vouch 03/08/2022 and on

*go back to getting back home from the walk, talk about the rest of that day, communicating to whomever was listening that you were well aware of what just took place and what it meant*

...

*talk about the next day, getting more pissed off, then acting it up a bit more*

...

*talk about that evening, seeing if they would react to me letting them kill me if they wanted to*

...

*talk about waking up the next day, funny Elvis Costello references, then end chapter on feeling very angry and wanting someone to be direct with me about what just happened given how infuriating it was given that I'm an innocent man, legally speaking*

*mention how infuriated you were in particular that Sam Hodges had connections to a Democratic party flaunting the idea of Diversity, and I had to deal with this bullshit in my brown-y brown skin, seems fucked up*
