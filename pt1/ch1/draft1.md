# Part 1 Chapter 1 -- Pre Vouch

### Notes

1. Ch 1 - Pre vouch, describe yourself, light intro to the TPL project, describe leaving social media as it's hard to tell when someone is being dishonest vs. distrustworthy; the former due to subterfuge, the latter more often due to wanting to be famous, with a healthy manipulative overlap in between. Recognizig social media as a null zone for social progress (good things are canceled out by bad more often than they're worth, no matter what side you're on), and wanting to normalize my life outside of social media and politics, just with a job. Vouch... seemed like the responsible decision, given the pedigree of the founders as well as the idea that "what could go wrong in a business insurance company surely they've worked the odds to eliminate their own professional or personal biases I mean look at how many times they say DEI in the PDF etc"



### Draft

Getting Microsoft's Blue Screen of Death in a Windows 10 install is rare, but possible, and like the board game _Clue_, was arguably more popular in the past. The Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD, is a rare computer-halting error state that will force you to turn off your machine, lest you wish to stare at a blue screen with an error message, hence the name. Similar to _Clue_, Microsoft's BSOD involves three things: your active OS thread has been murdered, in the stack trace, by, generally speaking, the weapon of shoddy programming.

Like I said, it doesn't happen as often these days, but the rules haven't changed: some program you were running on your computer caused the BSOD, they don't just happen.

So, just like in _Clue_, you have three distinct facts that add up to one question: who done it?

On January 28 2022 (check, was a friday), after accepting an offer in principal from Vouch inc, the only thing I was doing on my windows machine at the time was looking at a PDF of their business basics in a single chrome tab running Gmail's preview of the PDF.

Earlier that day I had what felt like an odd communication around the background check after accepting the offer. I immediately assumed the company was "looking into" my machine -- they may have found it odd that in my interviews I used my Apple Macbook, and had suddenly used a Windows machine to open an email, perhaps, though that has more to do with my Macbook being portable for more suitable webcam angles than my Windows machine, a desktop, can offer given it's position opposite to my framed covers of weird comic books.

Anyway, such tactics would be odd for a business insurance company to use from a black hat perspective -- I assumed at that point they or the background check company perhaps had a connection with the Federal Government whom would be more equipped for such hacking, even if it mistakenly led to a BSOD (admittedly, I don't often upgrade my windows machine, so it may have been a version conflict with their malware, but I digress).

There's only so many ways to "talk" to the Feds (or any extended network of surveillance and/or security they may be connected to within private spheres) if they're looking into you in ways that may have not involved a court order, at least digitally. Knowing, or at least hoping, my internet connection was being tracked if not my desktop machine itself, I restarted my machine and made some fecitious web requests in my browser, things that definitely didn't have DNS entries, like, but not limited to:

`https://look-im-not-here-to-do-anything-weird-im-just-here-for-the-equity.com/`
`https://do-what-you-need-i-get-it-but-lets-not-be-weird-ok.com/`
`https://that-said-please-dont-mess-up-my-games-or-music-its-all-i-use-this-machine-for.com/`

And such; my memory isn't perfect though I'd have to hope the NSA, or perhaps my internet provider Spectrum, could provide verification.

Look, does that seem weird to you? I'll tell you a bit about myself then, but, just a bit.

~~For the past 45 years I've been an undercover spy, with the first 8 being before I escaped my mother's womb -- ~~

I'm a computer programmer, and I've been one for like, 15 years. At times I've made some entrepreunerial endeavors that may have seemed "political."

In 2012 I helped coordinate a website called WeTheLobby dot com, with the intent of crowd funding lobbying money to fight SOPA, a potential bill which was later dropped rendering the site's intent a bit meaningless, and frankly the idea was a bit naiive itself.

In 2020, I tried crowdfunding a game out of a beta that had the intent of donating it's revenue to groups fighting against COVID 19 as well as climate change, with a hope to broaden it's scope and make the donations a matter of choice, so no one felt politically forced. However, I did attempt to co opt a rising tide of "social media socialism" that may have made me, to the eyes of the Feds a decade after WeTheLobby, a "person of internet based interest" or whatever.

So, I wasn't that surprised that I was being looked into this way. And if I was wrong -- it may have just been a random BSOD after all, or, some background process caused the crash, etc -- then I just typed in some of the stupidest URLs of all time that no one would buy for any reason. Also I don't think dashes are allowed in URLs, but, I digress.
