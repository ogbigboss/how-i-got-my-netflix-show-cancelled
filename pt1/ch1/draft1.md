# Part 1 Chapter 1 -- Pre Vouch

### Notes

1. Ch 0 - Short intro, blue screen of death, knowing Vouch was connected to current or ex Federal workers given the tactic of BSOD on a windows machine in 2023
1. Ch 1 - Pre vouch, describe yourself, light intro to the TPL project, describe leaving social media as it's hard to tell when someone is being dishonest vs. distrustworthy; the former due to subterfuge, the latter more often due to wanting to be famous, with a healthy manipulative overlap in between. Recognizig social media as a null zone for social progress (good things are canceled out by bad more often than they're worth, no matter what side you're on), and wanting to normalize my life outside of social media and politics, just with a job. Vouch... seemed like the responsible decision, given the pedigree of the founders as well as the idea that "what could go wrong in a business insurance company surely they've worked the odds to eliminate their own professional or personal biases I mean look at how many times they say DEI in the PDF etc"
1. Ch 2 - Vouch interview process, oddities in background check via HR dept, BSOD hacking attempt before starting



### Draft

_Late January 2022_

Getting Microsoft's Blue Screen of Death in a Windows 10 install is rare, but possible, and like the board game _Clue_, was arguably more popular in the past. The Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD, is a rare computer-halting error state that will force you to turn off your machine, lest you wish to stare at a blue screen with an error message, hence the name. Similar to _Clue_, Microsoft's BSOD involves three things: your active OS thread has been murdered, in the stack trace, by, generally speaking, the weapon of shoddy programming.

Like I said, it doesn't happen as often these days, but the rules haven't changed: some program you were running on your computer caused the BSOD, they don't just happen.

So, just like in _Clue_, you have three distinct facts that add up to one question: who done it?

On January 28 2022 (nts: check, was a friday), after accepting an offer in principal from Vouch inc, the only thing I was doing on my windows machine at the time was looking at a PDF of their business basics in a single chrome tab running Gmail's preview of the PDF.

Earlier that day I had what felt like an odd communication around the background check after accepting the offer. I immediately assumed the company was "looking into" my machine -- they may have found it odd that in my interviews I used my Apple Macbook, and had suddenly used a Windows machine to open an email, perhaps, though that has more to do with my Macbook being portable for more suitable webcam angles than my Windows machine, a desktop, can offer given it's position opposite to my framed covers of weird comic books.

Anyway, such tactics would be odd for a business insurance company to use from a black hat perspective -- I assumed at that point they or the background check company perhaps had a connection with the Federal Government whom would be more equipped for such hacking, even if it mistakenly led to a BSOD (admittedly, I don't often upgrade my windows machine, so it may have been a version conflict with their malware, but I digress).

There's only so many ways to "talk" to the Feds (or any extended network of surveillance and/or security they may be connected to within private spheres) if they're looking into you in ways that may have not involved a court order, at least digitally. Knowing, or at least hoping, my internet connection was being tracked if not my desktop machine itself, I restarted my machine and made some fecitious web requests in my browser, things that definitely didn't have DNS entries, like, but not limited to:

```

https://that-said-please-dont-mess-up-my-games-or-music-its-all-i-use-this-machine-for.com/
```

And such; my memory isn't perfect though I'd have to hope the NSA, or perhaps my internet provider Spectrum, could provide verification.

Look, does that seem weird to you? I'll tell you a bit about myself then, but, just a bit.

...

~~For the past 45 years I've been an undercover spy, with the first 8 being before I escaped my mother's womb~~

I'm a computer programmer, and I've been one for like, 15 years. At times I've made some entrepreunerial endeavors that may have seemed "political."

In 2012 I helped coordinate a website called WeTheLobby dot com, with the intent of crowd funding lobbying money to fight SOPA, a potential bill which was later dropped rendering the site's intent a bit meaningless, and frankly the idea was a bit naiive itself.

In 2020, I tried crowdfunding a game out of a beta that had the intent of donating it's revenue to groups fighting against COVID 19 as well as climate change, with a hope to broaden it's scope and make the donations a matter of choice, so no one felt politically forced. However, I did attempt to co opt a rising tide of "social media socialism" that may have made me, to the eyes of the Feds a decade after WeTheLobby, a "person of internet based interest" or whatever.

I'm not sure if it makes me more or less suspicious, but in the previous decade, I've not been a terribly active social media user. I don't like the stuff; I tried to make it work for a game project idea, but other than that social media isn't very me, which, I don't know, could be perceived as odd if you were investigating me.

So, I wasn't that surprised that I was being looked into this way. And if I was wrong -- it may have just been a random BSOD after all, or, some background process caused the crash, etc -- then I just typed in some of the stupidest URLs of all time that no one would buy for any reason. Also I don't think dashes are allowed in URLs, but, I digress.

That said, the attempt in 2020 and into 2021 to put together a game idea called _The Promised Land_ -- based more on the Springsteen song, and particularly the earnest part in the bridge about blowing away lies, but whatever -- had left me worse for the wear. Politically speaking, I've never thought ideologies are of much importance practically speaking, and that comes more from computer programming than not. Great, you're a functional programmer. If you're hired to work on an object oriented program, what're you gonna do, protest about it?

In truth, most programs are a mish mash of the ideals, and not ideologies, of the programmers who work on the program over days, months, years, and sometimes decades. The trick with object oriented programming, after all, is not to do too much of it, and otherwise, be like a functional programmer as much as possible in your constructs. Yes, the why not both? meme, that one.

Without accusing anyone of infantile behavior, I do wonder if social media is an appropriate place to discuss politics, given that honest dialogue over ideologies has never been a very _honest_ game, or in other words, remember when they used to say "off with their head?" Anyway, my attempt to infiltrate social media such to make a video game finance charities and good causes may have failed, and I don't think it has to do with any political ideology nearly as much as how much social media has distorted the value of fame -- it's cheaper than it looks.

Which is to say, after 2021, I decided to check out due to burn out, and stopped paying attention to politics and news media altogether. However, I had made an instagram account where I was playing guitar as a distraction, and a way to understand what I had missed out on over the last decade when I avoided social media -- why were people in such need for "likes"? I personally tracked my own habits with the program, how it made me feel, and had some fun with guitar riffs, so it may have been hard to "pattern" me using social media data.

Did that seem weird to them? It may have, idk. Looking back at the videos, I mostly feel I could have worked out a bit more as I was very skinny, but my playing seemed OK, and some people hit the like button on my reels, and that made me feel good.

So, in early 2022, I just wanted a job. Three companies gave me offers, and during one final interview, a CFO not at Vouch spoke highly of the CEO at Vouch, influencing my decision in an ironic way. I often wonder what if I wasn't impressed at someone else being impressed at someone so much that I went in that direction? Alas, I was grateful for the opportunity, and based on Vouch's position as a startup focused insurer, I felt the equity would work out, just as long as the Fed kept printing money at a consistent rate, the startup machine would never stop, not soon at least.

...

That Friday, January 28th 2022, When I got the email from the HR person at Vouch about onboarding there was some odd correspondence with regards to background checks and SSNs, which were being asked of separately. Why would a company want my SSN privately, as well as ask me to do a background check which would ask me the same information, and weeks before I would fill out an I9 tax document with the information anyway? It seemed a bit confusing to me, but I gave the SSN privately via a phone number provided, and filled out the online background check separately. Startups can be sloppy sometimes, it's not that big of a deal.

Anyway, I was working in NYC, for a company which had offices in San Francisco and Chicago, and talking to an HR person based in Chicago with about 3 other HR people CC'd. The background check form asked for a zip code for the company -- I looked up the first SF zip code I could find, hit enter, and was asked by the website to review the information first. I checked SF zip codes, and noticed there were a few. I then began to wonder if the company was actually, tax wise or whatever, based in Chicago. I didn't feel like looking shady and screwing up the background check form, so I asked Friday afternoon around 3 PM Chicago time via the email chain what the zip code was.

There were 3 other people, including the recruiter who worked with me earlier whom was also in the mid west, on the email, and no one responded. I didn't hit the final submit on my background check form.

Later that evening, while reviewing the company's PDF, looking at the pinwheel diagram which explained that the company would pickup the "best" startups (I assumed that meant those with the most VC traction) and stick with them as they grew, thus, the premiums would grow with the companies. Seemed smart, I thought, as long as the economy sticks with big tech, my equity might work out and not just my bosses'. At that high point, having just secured employment, and feeling as though I had made the right choice between three offers -- my Windows 10 gaming and music production machine did something it hadn't ever done before: given me it's Blue Screen Of Death.

I assumed the worst, I suppose, and handled it as best I could. On Monday, I hadn't received a response from Vouch, so around 3 PM (nts: check emails) I reached out. I received a response shortly after saying the background check actually cleared -- but I had never hit "confirm" on the final submission. Perhaps the company gathered the data pre-emptively, but, I still found this a bit, well, shady.

That said, a job's a job, and a white woman in Chicago working in an HR department can think a lot of things about a brown man in NYC working remotely for a tech department, and if a mistake was made, I wouldn't of minded if it stopped there.
