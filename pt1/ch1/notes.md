# Part 1 Chapter 1 -- Pre Vouch

### Notes

1. Ch 0 - Short intro, blue screen of death, knowing Vouch was connected to current or ex Federal workers given the tactic of BSOD on a windows machine in 2023
1. Ch 1 - Pre vouch, describe yourself, light intro to the TPL project, describe leaving social media as it's hard to tell when someone is being dishonest vs. distrustworthy; the former due to subterfuge, the latter more often due to wanting to be famous, with a healthy manipulative overlap in between. Recognizig social media as a null zone for social progress (good things are canceled out by bad more often than they're worth, no matter what side you're on), and wanting to normalize my life outside of social media and politics, just with a job. Vouch... seemed like the responsible decision, given the pedigree of the founders as well as the idea that "what could go wrong in a business insurance company surely they've worked the odds to eliminate their own professional or personal biases I mean look at how many times they say DEI in the PDF etc"
1. Ch 2 - Vouch interview process, oddities in background check via HR dept, BSOD hacking attempt before starting
