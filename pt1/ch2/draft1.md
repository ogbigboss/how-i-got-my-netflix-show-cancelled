# Pt 1 Ch 2

1. Ch 2 - First week at Vouch, Wednesday you innocently (hah) mumble out loud while reviewing the code base about "authentication", Thursday the CPO hints at audio surveillence via a work email, you reacting non chalantly (Thursday), then Friday they react by theatrically cutting your internet connection to see how you'd react, explain rationale and end chapter with you saying out loud to your work laptop you're now 95% sure is being used as an active audio surveillance item in conjunction with at least private companies (spectrum cable) if not government actors (the people who would convince spectrum cable this was not fascism): "Look, great, you hired someone from the mob or something to cut my internet connection down. I'm very impressed. Now I'll have a bunch of paper work to do, so if you're done impressing your friends, I'd appreciate you never doing it again." End Scene / chapter, explain your theater was in response to theirs, and knowing they were as full of shit as you were, just not nearly as entertaining. Mention Eloise indicating Rachel Bird's departure on Friday as well due to a previous sexual harrassment issue, and feeling as though she knew about the internet thing.
