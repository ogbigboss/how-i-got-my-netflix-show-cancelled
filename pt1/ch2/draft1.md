# Pt 1 Ch 2

### Notes

1. Ch 2 - First week at Vouch, Wednesday you innocently (hah) mumble out loud while reviewing the code base about "authentication", Thursday the CPO hints at audio surveillence via a work email, you reacting non chalantly (Thursday), then Friday they react by theatrically cutting your internet connection to see how you'd react, explain rationale and end chapter with you saying out loud to your work laptop you're now 95% sure is being used as an active audio surveillance item in conjunction with at least private companies (spectrum cable) if not government actors (the people who would convince spectrum cable this was not fascism): "Look, great, you hired someone from the mob or something to cut my internet connection down. I'm very impressed. Now I'll have a bunch of paper work to do, so if you're done impressing your friends, I'd appreciate you never doing it again." End Scene / chapter, explain your theater was in response to theirs, and knowing they were as full of shit as you were, just not nearly as entertaining. Mention Eloise indicating Rachel Bird's departure on Friday as well due to a previous sexual harrassment issue, and feeling as though she knew about the internet thing.

#### rough week outline
1. Monday - nothing weird, just Ronnie wasn't at the company after interviewing me 3 weeks ago
1. Tuesday - nothing weird, just noting the company seems a bit more "up in the air" than organized, more typical for start ups in general, but disappointing none the less -- Ronnie's departure seems likely a reason for this, but it's hard ot understand why one woman woudl mean that much to a company and leave so suddenly (i had no impression while being interviewed she was quitting, indicating a director gave 2 weeks notice and bounced)
1. Wednesday - nothing weird, start looking through codebase, note out loud it's weird they used Auth0 given how many developers of all kinds they had, seemed wasteful but more indicative of, in my experience, growing pains (it was useful then, it's probably not now, surprising they haven't ditched it given their VC funding size though considering it's not a requirement), that said I did talk aloud in front of my computer aobut "authentication"
1. Thursday - weird email re: authentication being discussed by a CPO almost *too* out of place, saying out loud "I wouldn't care if you were listening to me, I'd be more impressed if you were listening to me in the kitchen", proceeding to talk shit about them while washing dishes
1. Do the thing with the elipses to separate paragraphs and, take a moment to reflect that at the time of writing in 2023, a 21 year old Air National Guardsman is accused of leaking state secrets onto a "gamer focused" chat service called Discord after repeatedly being seen taking written notes and looking into intelligence information that had no relation to his day job. I had already felt that a combination of the tech company I worked for and some set of government services, along with at least a background check company if not another security firm altogether, were colluding in spying on me -- well, maybe. My assumption going back to the BSOD was that if this was that, then it was an effort being led by nearly one if not a tandem of 21 year old State workers who have constant access to intelligence outfits alongside the authority of the government, and that, if I could stop something like that, I oughta at least try. What am I afraid of, children in the government, which hires millions, whose brains have been warped by twitter so much they'd abuse a Federal Intelligence network for the gain of emoji approval via an internet chat service?
  1.1. Probably a good time to note the irony of you quitting social media only to be perhaps dragged into a federal investigation by people who spend way more time caring about such things than yourself, regardless of their rank or files
1. Friday - internet taken down, realizing it's just my apartment and not the area, assuming it's Vouch realizing this is gross abuse of authority that I will never have a legal claim against nor or a credible public claim so I might as well handle it myself. I act like I'm some sort of government worker and they've made paperwork for me and nothing more. If they're stupid enough to keep working within the government and not just, have like, a direct conversation about audio surveillance with me, then they deserve it, so after thinking things through, I say what I said to the audio surveillance laptop. My manager Eloise, in a weekly 1:1 meeting seems aware of the internet issue in an emotional tell. Eloise then tells me someone is leaving after being given 2 months off due to a sexual harrassment issue, and then after one week back, Rachel decided to leave. I wonder if somehow I scared Rachel away (hardly, I'm not _that_ good looking), but moreso I begin to wonder if Ronnie left due to similar issues of harrassment or sexism against women within Vouch, and I wonder if they did this internet trick to Ronnie or Rachel, and I felt better about my choices afterwards. Also, did Rachel Bird use Ingrid Bertram as a Slack photo, and if so, what was she trying to say with that? It certainly wasn't her face in that black and white photo with the movie lighting. After 1 week? No one gave me any work to do. Startups, I guess.


### Draft

> "In any kind of covert operation, one of the toughest challenges is using information you're not supposed to have." - Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Working remotely wasn't new to me -- somewhere two decades ago around 2001 my father, who worked for IBM for some 3 decades, was transferred away from his office in Cranford NJ and into his home office in our house of Montclair NJ. I believe this was mostly because the office was closing in Cranford and seen as a way to save money. My father finished his career working remotely, and, given the times, audio surveillance wasn't really something I ever felt IBM put into our family household, and was mostly something for the likes of TV shows.

These days, as more move to remote working whether due to chronic health issues as well as epidemics like Covid, costs savings, comfort, or all three, it's well known many corporations are utilizing audio surveillance as it's more feasible with modern CPUs.

Before 2020, I was upset the way I discovered this -- via a boss' psychological immaturity -- but by 2022, I accepted it as some kind of weird reality.

...

Back in 2020, I went through an experience that confirmed to my suspicions that some companies in "big tech" were using audio surveillance on their remote employees. As a computer programmer, I knew this wasn't hard to pull off and hide -- audio processing takes a minute amount of power on a modern CPU, to where it wouldn't interfere with the average worker bee's day. The way I figured out was the immaturity in how the audio surveillance was being used -- it seemed if I setup myself as a joke, my bosses were more than likely to play off it in meetings, indicating they were listening, and they were not threatened but willing to use it as a cheap way to feel superior, like children. But that was then.

In 2020, I was working for a former frat boy president running a startup in an industry known for emotional immaturity, surrounded by mid 30s and 20 year olds. In 2022, I was starting at Vouch, a company being run by 40 year olds, surrounded by 30 year old co workers, in the decidedly more mature industry of business insurance. I thought, before starting, that even if they used audio surveillance, surely they'd be more mature about it.

...


I really enjoy working remotely. I enjoy it mostly because while I'm working, there aren't a bunch of people flying around an office, alerting my peripheral vision, talking aloud about reasonable topics I have to filter out with maturity or music, which itself can be a distraction, taking a shit around people and having to deal with the social consequences -- literally none of these things are things I have to deal wiht remotely. Studies show there isn't much "productivity" to be gained via the "in person water cooler" moments, but, I'll admit many humans are more social creatures than I, so an office may be ideal and needed for many others.

I think the "remote first" model with an office to support those with social needs would be best for the future, but alas.

I also like to talk aloud while I write or evaluate computer programs.

In offices, I limit this to an occasional one word mumble, if anything. Sometimes, I may make the more embarassing mistake of singing along to what I'm listening to.

"Alone" in my apartment, I'll sometimes carry a bit of a conversation about the code I'm working on. It may sound like I'm talking to someone on the phone -- I'm just thinking one thought, then saying another aloud. I like to think I'm hijacking the part of the brain that listens, and just speeding up the process of being as obejctive as I can in my approaches to computer programming.

You might think it's crazy, but I've talked to a lot of therapists about it, and they don't, often categorizing it as a type of self talk.

All these things came to an odd head of sorts early on at Vouch. My instinct was not to care, because, if it was a problem, surely someone would be direct and just ask me about it.

Wouldn't you do that if you were confused about something a co-worker or employee said aloud to themselves or anyone else in an office?

Why would working remotely be any different, even with audio surveillance replacing the idea of a shared amount of oxygen in an office setting?

After 2022, I wonder if emotional immaturity is more acceptable compared to pure political cowardice. I didn't get a severance after being harrassed via "covert" audio surveillance in 2020, but at least compared to 2022 the government never got involved, at least to my knowledge, and certainly not my _mother_.

...

_Early February 2022_ (nts: get weeks where needed from notes and calendar, should be second week of Feb)

My first two days at Vouch were of little incident or consequence. I met my manager, Eloise, and thought she was really friendly. She had a Steve Martin poster her wife had bought with hats referencing many of his movies, and was fairly outgoing. There was a meeting for the new employees to meet the "C Levels" - the C*O's of the company, the top leadership structure of the then ~ 50 employee large firm - it was scheduled for Tuesday, but cancelled suddenly in the morning. I thought that was a bit weird, but not a big deal.

Another thing I thought was weird was Ronnie Wang, a woman I had interviewed with some 3 weeks ago, whom held a Director position and would have been my boss' boss, was not at the company when I joined. That meant she likely hadn't told them she was leaving when she interviewed me (nts: check dates, think it was 1/24), and gave her two weeks notice the following week. This is irregular for a Director -- typically a departure is coordinated with months, not an employee's standard two weeks, given their importance to the company.

Unless, for some reason, she, didn't care and decided to quit, giving Vouch the least time to react. I checked on LinkedIn and couldn't imagine her equity position being better where she landed, another tech finance outfit. I took a mental note: _evaluate Vouch's organization -- if they seem disorganized, that meant Ronnie ran things and she left in a huff to make a point. If they don't seem disorganized, then maybe I'm wrong._

When I was first hired, my boss was to be a man named Eric, and a week after I got the offer, I was told it would be a woman named Eloise. No biggie, but a sudden shift in internal management usually points to disorganization.

Just some things I told myself to keep in mind should the company appeared disorganized or mismanaged at a later time.

...

It's not terribly abnormal to _not_ get a work item your first week on a tech gig as a web developer -- usually you're setting up the code bases of whatever program you're working on so you have a "local" or "development" setup on your machine that you can use to edit code in an isolated fashion, separate from whatever live servers run the business. Setting things up took awhile, but I recall being up and running within my first few days.

I was hired to largely be a front end developer -- this is the part of the website that runs in your device's browser, and communicates to the server. I have experience with working the latter, but for this job, my focus was a leadership role in the former. One thing I don't take for granted is that as a front end developer, I'm largely divorced from any customer data while working on my local environment. That said, the concept of _authentication_ -- one of the principal things that happens whenever you supply a user and password -- does partially happen on the client side, even if the important part -- the part where the password gets checked for validity -- doesn't; that's on the server.

So, while reviewing the codebase to which I was hoping to dedicate years of my life to, I looked at, well, the page I was looking at when I started my local development setup - the login page.

You may be familiar with the idea of a login page.

One thing I often do is look at the code that assembles the page to see how it behaves: it's a big part of my job.

The login page being the first page I looked at had a lot to do with the website in question - the company's "app." website to manage data, not it's more sales oriented main "www." website - locking you out until you login... like... many if not most data oriented websites.

While looking at the login page for Vouch's site, I noticed they were using a third party provider for authentication that I was familiar with - _Auth0_. Now, if you asked me to my _face_ my opinion on whether a company like Vouch - dozens of developers, 8 figures in funding - needs or ought to be relying on a third party provider for something like authentication, I'd be more polite.

I'm pretty sure I said some judgemental things out loud such as "why would they still be using this?" I'm not really... _sure_ what I said, to be honest, because I was just wondering why a company that size, with that many developers, without the need for dynamic machine to machine keys or anything really that Auth0 provides -- why would they need this?

Honestly, there may have been a good answer! I may have been being judgemental. To myself, alone, in my apartment.

To be clear: three days into a job, I do have to say that I wasn't "casing the joint", because, as a matter of knowing how to do my job as a web developer -- knowing that Vouch.us uses Auth0 would be simple as visiting their incredibly public website and seeing Auth0's URLs listed somewhere in the requests made to compose the incredibly public website Vouch.us used that they were hiring me to help make.

It's kind of like seeing the brand name of a lock on the door of your employer's office, probably not something weird for the guy who works on the front of the employer's office, website wise, to take note of.

Meaning, finding out Vouch used Auth0 for authentication wasn't a secret. If I wanted to know, I could've found out without every working there or looking at their code.

But again, I may have sounded _really_ judgemental.

That was Wednesday, and other than making a note to ask someone why they used it, and another note to myself to be nice about it and not "judgy" when I asked, I didn't think much else about it. Every developer would make every website different given their own choices; if anything I just told myself I may have to spend time with Auth0, a product I had experience in from previous jobs, and moved on with my business from there.

... 

When starting a job with a new company email, I make a losing effort to check all my email and retain the fabled "inbox 0" state of zero emails unread in my inbox.

It works for the first few weeks.

That first week, it was working - I had read every email, just as a way to get familiar with the company.

On Thursday, I got a somewhat peculiar email that made me think, for the first time that year, that _another_ company may be audio surveilling me.

But I couldn't be sure -- to be honest, I still can't without the company admitting to it -- so I asked myself a complicated question that was maybe my "programmer brain" solving a social problem I could have been better ignoring:

_How could I let them know that I didn't care if they were listening to me without doing anything weird, like asking them in a meeting my first week if they were listening to me?_

I really, really, hate meetings.

My boss' boss made an update to some internal company document, and the software which holds the document sent an email to a mailing list I was on about the update. I can't remember all the points, but under a section with about 4 bullet points, a fifth one was added, and it made the section read like one of those multiple choice questions, with the prompt asking you _which one does not belong_.

The last point, erroneous to the preceeding points, was about authentication.

My boss' boss, the CPO, wasn't terribly technical and neither were the points in the list - authentication is a pretty technical term, most other departments, including Product, may refer to this as the login section.

That said, I'm new! I could be wrong! It's just... an email?

But I was considering the BSOD from earlier, my experiences from 2020, and began considering that I could be under some kind of "investigation", with a possibility of federal involvement, and that my boss' boss, a fellow male of South Asian decent, may have been trying to... tell me something?

Which I thought was weird - why wouldn't he just... tell me? The thought came to me:

_How could I let them know that I didn't care if they were listening to me without doing anything weird, like asking them in a meeting my first week if they were listening to me?_

And then another, qualifying thought, asking this:

_Why am I suspicious and what are the rational ways I could be correct such to justify the above would have any effect, and what happens if I'm wrong?_

If you're not a computer programmer, that's ok. Just read the below like words, and ignore the other parts.

It's how I thought through the situation.

You might think I'm foolish.

```
if you_live_in_2022_aka_audio_surveillance_is_technically_feasible then
    if you_do_something_to_let_them_know_you_dont_care then
        if they_are_not_listening then
            nothing_will_happen_that_would_be_odd_or_connected_because_they_are_not_listening
        else
            if they_are_investigating_you then
                hopefully_they_would_be_direct_at_that_point
            else
                hopefully_they_would_be_direct_at_that_point
            end
        end
    end
end
```

Take your time with it, but to translate in english, the logical answer to the question "why would I react to this in such a way to test if they were audio surveilling me" would be this:

_If I live in 2022 and audio surveillance is thus technically feasible in a remote working scenario, and then I do something like saying words to the audio surveillance to indicate to anyone listening or recording that I am not threatened by it's presence, if they're indeed not listening, then nothing should come of it, elsewise, if they are listening, whether or not they are investigating me, hopefully they would be direct at that point._

As a programmer, you rarely get it right the first time, even if you write perfect tests and such.

Sometimes you just need to run the program to find out you were wrong about an assumption you made.

So, well, "FML" as the kids say, but I thought of the above and figure'd what harm could come if, in my apartment, I vocally addressed my suspicions about the email, and finished by saying something like the below:

> "Look, if you're audio surveilling me I don't care. I'd be more impressed if you were listening to me in my kitchen, but anyway, I don't care. Do what you need to."

I can't remember my exact words because, at this point, I didn't think it would be necessary to try and remember things like that, but I do remember the line about the kitchen. Perhaps my latent heterosexism caused me to lean on a bit of machismo -- I'm saying I don't care, but, I hadn't realized an easily bullied, triggerable leader who likes to play games more than mind their business may react by thinking: _Well, if he wants to be impressed, let's impress him._

My empathy limits it's bounds at sociopathy. It's probably why I've never been interested in middle management.

Anyway, I remember at that point going to my kitchen and talking random shit about Silicon Valley, but really just focusing on the whole "you ruined San Francisco" thing, while washing my dishes. I didn't say anything personal -- I barely knew these people, I just started working there -- so I stuck to general shit talk about how the Mission sucks and it used to be better (I cannot prove this to be honest), and how the Warriors _probably_ only got Durant because of some backwater deal involving tech stocks, but I digress -- my random espionage tinged encouters with NBA celebrity come up later in my story.

...

Earlier in the week I had met my "team", or the coworkers I would be working closesly with in my department. Everyone was very friendly and introduced themselves with all kinds of info - their hobbies, their families, their recent projects at work - except for one person, who spoke briefly if ever and was not present at the meeting where I introduced myself to everyone, a Rachel Bird.

I did see her in Slack, a chat software, as well as a few online meetings, however, she spoke tersely in response to Eloise when prompted, and her face was hidden. In it's stead an image she had uploaded was displayed, and it was a black and white photo of a woman in a hairstyle along with the kind of lighting and exposure that meant it was a photo of an old actress, likely from the 30s-50s.

Rachel never made conversation so I never got to ask, but I remember thinking to myself, a former Blockbuster employee, this:

_Hey, is that a picture of Ingrid Bergman, famous for her character Paula in the 1944 film_ Gaslight?

I wasn't certain, though I was grateful at that moment for my mother and her mother, my grandmother's, habit of watching _Nick at Nite_ as well as daytime reruns, and thus knowing a bit about older films and television. Even if I was wrong, and though these films are older, looking back on what happened I am _especially_ grateful to my grandmother for loving shows like _Matlock_, _Columbo_, and of course _Murder She Wrote_, and I wonder how much those helped in deducing how full of shit many of you all were and may still be.

Per my uncertainty, I thought about googling for pictures of Ingrid Bergman, or even aking Rachel, but then I realized I might be under some sort of surveillance which meant monitoring my internet connection, and I didn't want to give anyone at the company the impression that I was interested in someone.

Rachel's last day was the following Friday, an interesting day for me as well.

...

With disregard to "surveillance," working from home generally involves making sure you're visibly online in some sort of chat software, at the very least, though it's not always required. I was making a habit in my first week of opening my laptop at just about 10:30 AM ET and signing off at 7:30 PM ET. I'd generally take a half hour to hour long lunch so this worked out to a 9 hour total workday.

On the last day of my first week, when I opened my laptop, I couldn't connect to the internet.

These things happen. I check my phone and see a text message.

Spectrum, my internet provider, had texted me at 10:28 AM that day, February 18th, 2022 -- I had a service outage (nts: maybe link photo if you can. given that tying this to an actual pitch will definitely mean taking it out of markdown and into "something else", it may be difficult, look into how things are normally pitched, if a PDF is ok then use some markdown to website to PDF generator, etc).

These things happen! Not wanting to be virtually "late", I thought little of taking out my iPhone and using it's internet to tether to, and continued working. I had some meetings where I chose not to share my webcam feed to save on data as well as keep my internet connection stable.

I moved into the building I live in around 10 years ago, and have "suffered" internet outages before. Post 2012, when I moved in, the internet was pretty stabalized as a necessity to do most things, though not all. When outages happen, especially on nice days -- it was a bright, sunny, not that chilly or windy February day, beautiful realy -- people tend to congregate outside a bit more, and Covid wasn't as much of a threat by 2022. I noticed near the mid afternoon that, well, things outside seemed pretty normal.

Funny, but, hey. I was tethered to my phone; maybe everyone else was too.

I decided to then walk down the hall to throw some garbage out in the chute. As I walked, I could hear many of my neighbors living their lives rather normally as they would at that time -- many worked from home, had meetings like I did, and many watched television during the day while working or otherwise from their apartments, such audio is normal -- but in 2022, it would assume that everyone else had a working internet connection but me.

I check Twitter primarily for evidence of an outage in my area, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, anywhere in Manhattan at that moment -- I couldn't find anything saying that others were suffering an outage.

I sighed inside, and thought through some things.

```

        nothing_would_happen_because_no_one_did_this
    end
  end
end
```

In english, _if my internet connection is down, but my neighbors isn't, and somehow this was done in response to me saying Id be more impressed if you audio surveilled me in my kitchen, and it makes me wonder why Ronnie left abruptly as a Director, then I ought to try and embarass whoever did this, because if they have government connections, they're fascists, if not, they're just bullies, and if none of this is "really connected", then I don't have anything to worry about because nothing else will happen if I try to embarass whomever did this, because then in that case, they didn't_.

The next logic puzzle was figuring out how to respond; what to say and why.

...

It was maybe 10 months later, but when I watched the Emilio Estevez cinematic classic _Men at Work_, lines of dialogue shared by he and his brother Charlie Sheen's characters described exactly what I wanted to achieve, with, well, a prank.

> James: ... a pellet gun? What are you going to accomplish using that stupid thing?
>
> Carl: It allows me to seriously aggravate a situation without actually changing the course of history. It also stings like a b***h.

It took me maybe 3 months later, but I also for the first time watched _Apolcalypse Now_ in full, and couldn't help but note Coppola and Company's stressing the point of emotional immaturity not just amongst the ranks of the infantry, but through the leadership as well, perhaps best expressed in Robert Duval's role of Colonel Kilgore.

I didn't need to watch that movie to know that the most powerful military in the world, at any point in history, has had to suffer the mistakes of youth as influenced by emotional immaturity, and will continue to. Calling things out directly isn't always helpful as the immaturity can be within the ranks of leadership or legal outfits at say, the JAG level; the court system which would handle military affairs separate from civil ones.

(Also, _Apocalypse Now_ centers around Martin Sheen's character's mission is to "take care of" his former comrade Marlon Brando's character, so, I felt a prank would be better than anything "official".)

A year later in 2023, as i write this, the country was rocked by an intelligence leak. One Jack Texiera stands accused of accessing classified military information and then spreading it online, on a gamer chat service called Discord of all things. I'd fear for the country's security if not for the fact that Mr. Texiera's actions reflects the immaturity often found in military outfits historically, which is to say, such things aren't distinctly American.

That is said, in 2022, I didn't know Jack Texiera's name, but I figure'd whoever was behind this -- if they were at all -- had the emotional maturity of a 20 year old who spends their time on online chat services and social media.

If they were older or less male it woudn't matter, at least the former point was proven to me by Robert Duvall's performance as Colonel Kilgore: even those in charge can be reduced to children if you figure out what their surf board is and take it away.

Whomever my Colonel Kilgore was, their surf board to me seemed like the ability to take my internet connection down - "just to see how I'd react." Such tactics are useful against criminal organizations, but, I'm not that, and there's no evidence to point me to that in a way a court order could be aquired to legally take my internet down, so, I felt like it was time to take away my Colonel Kilgore's surf board, whomever they were.

If I got away with it, I'd never know who it was, and technically, I still don't.

...

My mission was clear: I needed to embarass whoever did this in a way that would have no effect if I was wrong, but if I was right, my actions would have to would force whoever did this to take action amongst their superiors within the government which would eventually embarass them.

_What are these people hoping for anyway?_

If they took down my internet, they were probably thinking they'd "interrupt" whatever "criminal" activities I "must" be doing using that connection. If the police know of a location where drug dealers use say, any type of electricity, as those growing hydroponic marijuana indoors may with the halogen lights requried to do so, then sometimes they'll cut the electricity of the area to see how the drug dealers will react. Maybe they'll change locations, reveal their stashes, or act erratically in a way which adjusts their business operations to reveal to authorities what they were up to.

Marijuana having been legalized by 2022 in the great state of New York, I looked at my bong with little fear. I rarely had over the legal limit of marijuana, most times nowhere close to the 3 ounce maximum (nts: check laws). I asked myself a peculiar question which has since, become rather standard form procedure in any of my thought processes:

_Am I doing anything illegal right now?_

In terms of crimes that would get me behind bars or serve any "jail time", no. At times you could get me on misdemeanors -- jaywalking, mostly -- but, no, in the time that I was being investigated up to this moment, I've not committed any crimes that would put me behind bars.

So, then what to do given that I knew my innocence was provable?

The thought came to mind:

_I also need to prevent them from falsely incriminating me._

My only answer there was this: I need to be as appealing of a possible "collar" or "get" to the person as I can be, such that they will act in earnest, up until the point that they ask the investigative services (FBI, most likely) to look into my background, at which point they'll find nothing, and be embarassed by not only their superiors but hopefully create a minor inter-departmental "snafu" and forever be known as "that guy" -- Jack Texiera should live a healthy, full life, but he should, in my opinion, have no way up the ladder in terms of government employment as well.

In most programming languages, a "function" is a group of code that can be refered to by it's name and thus "executed," similar to having a play "codenamed" in say a sports game or an intelligence operation and having that name refer to a predetermined set of actions.

I'll admit, this set of logic was a bit more dynamic than previous sets. I probably could have come up with a lot of other ways to satisfy my base constraints which were:

1. I need to get whoever did this to take it further up the chain so I'm investigated by the FBI with NSA assistance, most likely. This will clear my name and make them look stupid, and probably keep me under whatever tabs I'm under due to previous entrepreunerial ambitions.
1. I need to do it in a way that doesn't let them know I think they're the government
1. I need to do it in a way such that if I'm called out, I can easily explain it as a joke without losing face.

Here's what I came up with, and yes, it was probably heavily inspired by my favorite TV show of all time, _Burn Notice._ I was going to convince them that actually, I was working for the government. I was hpoing that would be easy enough to sort out as ridiculous, for, the government.

Me, to my laptop, without any meetings in the background, while I was writing code or checking emails, sometime that afternoon of February 18th, 2022:

> "Wow. You got me. You got some mob connection to cut the wire in my apartment building and now my internet connection is down. I'm really scared -- look, now I'm going to have to do a bunch of paperwork. I appreciate your efforts to have fun here, but, if you could just not pull that little stunt again, and treat me like a normal employee, I think we'll be ok."

I never said "I'm a spy" or that I "work for the government" -- just that I knew it was them that cut my internet connection down, and that I assumed they hired a "mob" person to "cut the wire" in my building, things I certainly wasn't actually suspicious of, but I figure'd it would give enough cover to the superiors in this situation to pull out as I wasn't suspicious and things were better that way if they ended that way.

Things did not end that way, but maybe that's my fault.

I didn't think much more of the situation until I ended that afternoon with a 1:1 with my manager Eloise, and she told me why Rachel Bird, after a two month paid leave, was leaving Vouch for good.

Reader, you may be wondering: if they _had_ confronted you, and asked why you lied about being a government spy or intelligence worker of some sort, what would I have said?

I had made a plan, and it was to respond thusly, if I was asked why I lied.

_Oh, well I thought we were both lying about being spies. That wasn't the joke here?_

Look, I probably would've gotten fired, but like I said I had two other job offers and if things happened quickly I doubt they would've gotten to a point where the government would have to try the loudest "cover up" of all time as opposed to just minding their own business.

Alas, maybe more people are pretending at what they are than I realize.
