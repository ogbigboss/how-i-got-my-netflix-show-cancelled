# Pt 1 Ch 2

1. Ch 2 - First week at Vouch, Wednesday you innocently (hah) mumble out loud while reviewing the code base about "authentication", Thursday the CPO hints at audio surveillence via a work email, you reacting non chalantly (Thursday), then Friday they react by theatrically cutting your internet connection to see how you'd react, explain rationale and end chapter with you saying out loud to your work laptop you're now 95% sure is being used as an active audio surveillance item in conjunction with at least private companies (spectrum cable) if not government actors (the people who would convince spectrum cable this was not fascism): "Look, great, you hired someone from the mob or something to cut my internet connection down. I'm very impressed. Now I'll have a bunch of paper work to do, so if you're done impressing your friends, I'd appreciate you never doing it again." End Scene / chapter, explain your theater was in response to theirs, and knowing they were as full of shit as you were, just not nearly as entertaining. Mention Eloise indicating Rachel Bird's departure on Friday as well due to a previous sexual harrassment issue, and feeling as though she knew about the internet thing.

Back in 2020, I went through an experience that confirmed to my suspicions that some companies in "big tech" were using audio surveillance on their remote employees. As a computer programmer, I knew this wasn't hard to pull off and hide -- audio processing takes a minute amount of power on a modern CPU, to where it wouldn't interfere with the average worker bee's day. The way I figured out was the immaturity in how the audio surveillance was being used -- it seemed if I setup myself as a joke, my bosses were more than likely to play off it in meetings, indicating they were listening, and they were not threatened but willing to use it as a cheap way to feel superior, like children. But that was then.

Back in 2020, I was working for a former frat boy president running a startup in an industry known for emotional immaturity, surrounded by mid 30s and 20 year olds. In 2022, I was starting at Vouch, a company being run by 40 year olds, surrounded by 30 year old co workers. I thought, before starting, that even if they used audio surveillance, surely they'd be more mature about it.

After 2022, I wonder if emotional immaturity is more acceptable compared to pure political cowardice. I didn't get a severance after being harrassed via "covert" audio surveillance in 2020, but at least compared to 2022 the government never got involved, at least to my knowledge, and certainly not my _mother_.
