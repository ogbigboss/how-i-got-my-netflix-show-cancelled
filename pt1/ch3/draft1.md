# Pt 1 Ch 3 -- the last normal weekend of my life

### Notes
1. Ch 3 - A brief chapter where you emotinally reflect on your weekend after the first week, and how you try to distract yourself / endear yourself to one of your coworkers (T Thompson) via recording you playing with your new guitar pedals, something they've expressed interest in. When you pickup the guitar though, for _some reason_... the Xfiles theme comes out.
1. Took like over a year almost to get back to that guitar effects pedalboard I setup, which, is mostly a me thing, but whatever, last weekend before things get weird in a way where time is just another part of the record and not a part of my lived experience
1. Go over reasoning for the Xfiles thing -- recording a video and sharing it with a coworker _should_ show normal people I was joking about the spy (I never said the word spy, but anyway) thing. If, somehow, the people who shut my internet connection down started asking about if there was a "real" "Xfiles" "department" within any hall of government, well, I figure'd that might be possible, but, given that I felt at that point they were acting like their lives were television shows in a childish way, I also knew it'd give me the opportunity, in a direct confrontation, to point out how childish they were, in a passive aggressive way
1. The whole point of the thing _was_ and _is still_ to get the companies that audio surveilled me into a federal investigation to _admit_ they were listening to me "covertly" and _that's_ what started this. Just ask me directly after admitting it and I'd say "I knew, that's why I was joking about being a government worker and being part of the Xfiles"
1. Remember that in this chapter you're just mapping out the consequences and thinking that there is no way a video of you playing the xfiles theme on a guitar with a set of pedal effects (it was to switch between two tones to separate the rhythm and lead lines as best I could) could make this situaiton "worse" as they had just used not at all judicial methods to shut your internet connection down to try and intimidate you at "best"
1. Save the upload to slack for the next chapter's beggining
1. You could say you were using game theory at this point to be snotty

### Draft

Entering the weekend, and after that meeting with Eloise, I began to wonder if these people weren't going to get that I was joking. To me, something of a snob, that would only suggest they weren't a company worth spending years with, and I'd find a way out sooner than later, or I'd get fired.

I sighed -- I really, really, really was looking for a company to stay at for years, stabalize my debts, and move out of my expensive apartment to someplace more reasonable after a years worth of saving enough cash to do so. The last few years had been tough on me and many via Covid, and I was looking to get settled.

That said, I realized that if I was right about the company's behaviors, then I wasn't wrong about making a joke out of it. How could you be right when your boss is the one that's wrong? You're not in charge.

One of my new coworkers was a man named Tony Thompson. He was extremely kind during the interview, and after I was given an offer emailed me personally to ask if I had any questions or just wanted to chat while I was considering the offer. While joining, during the "get to know you" session, I found out he learned guitar with his son during the Covid lockdown, and they were both into guitar sound effect pedals; two of my bigger hobbies. I had chatted a few times with Tony during that first week online about boutique guitar pedal manufacturers; Chase Bliss, Old Blood Noise Endeavors, and others.

Just prior to joining Vouch, I had setup a "pedal board" - a preconfigured collection of effects pedals placed on a board such that you can move them easily - which I was quite proud of. That weekend I had just figured out some of the ways MIDI worked and decided that it may be a nice way to endear myself to a new colleague I'd be working close with if I shot a video of me playing with the pedals.

One of the pedals, a Chase Bliss MKII Automatone (nts: double check name), has mechanical faders which literally move when you change the preset, which is unique. I setup this and other pedals to have two sound effects, and thought it would be cool to make a video which shows both.

As I often do, I strummed a chord in the 5th fret A Minor position. My guitar, a Sunbust Gibson ES-339, was tuned down a whole step so technically I was playing a G Minor chord.

No one really knows how the brain works, though we have made a lot of progress, it's still largely a mystery why we think what we think when we think it. But for some reason, I heard _The X Files_ theme song in my head, and realized my two presets worked rather perfectly.

(For those unaware or underage, _The X Files_ was an excellent 90s TV series on Fox starring Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny where they played FBI agents working for a fictitious department concerning supernatural, alien activities.)

I could finger pick the lower piano lines, add a delay repeater, and get something similar. The higher pitched lead lines sounded perfectly _spooky_ with the other preset I had setup, and allowed for those cool motorized faders to fly around as I swapped back and forth, first playing the lower notes on one effect preset, then the higher pitched lead lines on another effect preset.

I have a pretty good memory and it's not hard for me to pick out a tune "by ear" as they say, sometimes I combine the two and I can pick out a song from memory. As I went online to double check my memory (I was off a bit rhythmically though not melodically), I chuckled inside, and realized I had maybe solved a problem of how to make it clear that I was joking about being a government worker that now "had a lot of paperwork" to do because of my boss' "little stunt."

_The X Files is a fucking TV show. These people are acting like they're on a TV show to me. Maybe they'll get it if I hint that the government "agency" I work for is the X Files. If they don't there's a chance that my government aided harraser will go around asking if the X Files exists, which, is even better if you ask me._

Tony Thompson had been very charitable with his time in that first week; he chatted with me when he could and always responded with his opinion on whatever guitar pedal got brought up.

I filmed myself on my iPhone playing the X Files theme over the weekend.

I still wasn't sure if anything I was suspicious of was real - to be honest, I was hoping it wasn't and nothing would happen - so I do remember this as the last "normal" weekend of my life, where I didn't have the suspicion of being "watched" inside my own apartment, be it via a digital form of surveillance, or by someone looking at me through my windows, or something else I wasn't aware of.

That said, on Monday when I returned to work, at sometime in the AM before Tony coudl wake up on the West Coast, I uploaded my video of me playing _The X Files_' theme song, and while sending the video over Slack to Tony, said out loud to my audio surveillance laptop the following:

> "This is the only hint I'm gonna give you."

And that was that. If they were dumb enough to get caught up in this, and act like _The X Files_ was real, then, I had to hope my mission of stopping the government career of wahtever 20 year old dipshitted Jack Texiera deserved it was accomplished.

...

I remember a few years ago seeing former CIA director John O. Brennan takling affirmatively about, well, Aliens and shit. They're out there. We don't know much, and what we do can't be explained, but that's what we know. He wasn't exactly shady about it, and kind of smiled during it as I remember. Here's a quote of his I just found on the internet:

> "I think it's a bit presumptuous and arrogant for us to believe that there's no other form of life anywhere in the entire universe."

I was pretty sure, reader, that there was no _X files_ department, and if there was, it probably wasn't all that shady.

That said, you may again be wondering the following: _What exactly would you have said when they asked you why you lied about being a part of the X Files?_

Well, I would have to first allude to playing the guitar, and a decent knowledge of 60s era tunes, but I think I would've said:

_Well, the truth is, if you were listening to my music than you'd already know that I was pretty far out there, man._

Look, it never happened, and things got weirder from there that second week, so I never had a chance to wonder how I'd clean up that line of dialogue, because I never got to deliver it.

I'm sure somewhere Ms. Anderson and Mr. Duchovny, as well as their FakeBI counterparts Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder respectively, would understand. All four of them.

...

Tony Thompson never slack chatted to me again during my employment, never offering his thoughts on my cool pedal board, or what he, a man in his 40s, thought of _The X Files_ when growing up, after responding to everything else we had spoken on that week.
