# Pt 1 ch 4 -- Second week at Vouch

### Summary

1. Ch 4 - Second week, start with google doc showing poor internal comms and shitty spelling at a C level, weird cross C level insinuations, CIO no show with weird camera tricks, lawyer also uses weird camera tricks, end with them forcing Eloise, my new LGBTQ female manager who seemed nice to act as though Putin wasn't a threat, which was weird, because this happened on literally the first morning after the first day of the invasion in Ukraine, which I assume is when most people in the US were just becoming aware of that event. I read the news, had they not, and even if they had, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Whatever, it was Friday. 

### Notes

1. Indicate that Eloise's awkward suggestion of Putin not being a threat -- smoething you read as not Eloise's genuine opinion but something she was asked to say, at least in your opinion -- that this had something to do with the Democrat party, possibly the DNC, and it was the first time the crazy thought that _yeah sure quite possibly the white house is inovlved but that would be absurd wouldnt it_, and kept the thought in the back of your head where you keep other absurd thoughts, and foreshadow the gradual development of that thought's relocation in your head
1. Talk a bit more about _The Promised Land_ game, check how much you wrote on it before, make something that develops on top of what was already said while explaining the motivations behind the possible noveau centrist lean towards fascism, just sans bittenburgers. "Politics"
