# Pt 1 Ch 4 -- the last normal weekend of my life

### Notes
1. Ch 4 - A brief chapter where you emotinally reflect on your weekend after the first week, and how you try to distract yourself / endear yourself to one of your coworkers (T Thompson) via recording you playing with your new guitar pedals, something they've expressed interest in. When you pickup the guitar though, for _some reason_... the Xfiles theme comes out.
1. Took like over a year almost to get back to that guitar effects pedalboard I setup, which, is mostly a me thing, but whatever, last weekend before things get weird in a way where time is just another part of the record and not a part of my lived experience
1. Go over reasoning for the Xfiles thing -- recording a video and sharing it with a coworker _should_ show normal people I was joking about the spy (I never said the word spy, but anyway) thing. If, somehow, the people who shut my internet connection down started asking about if there was a "real" "Xfiles" "department" within any hall of government, well, I figure'd that might be possible, but, given that I felt at that point they were acting like their lives were television shows in a childish way, I also knew it'd give me the opportunity, in a direct confrontation, to point out how childish they were, in a passive aggressive way
1. The whole point of the thing _was_ and _is still_ to get the companies that audio surveilled me into a federal investigation to _admit_ they were listening to me "covertly" and _that's_ what started this. Just ask me directly after admitting it and I'd say "I knew, that's why I was joking about being a government worker and being part of the Xfiles"
1. Remember that in this chapter you're just mapping out the consequences and thinking that there is no way a video of you playing the xfiles theme on a guitar with a set of pedal effects (it was to switch between two tones to separate the rhythm and lead lines as best I could) could make this situaiton "worse" as they had just used not at all judicial methods to shut your internet connection down to try and intimidate you at "best"
1. Save the upload to slack for the next chapter's beggining
1. You could say you were using game theory at this point to be snotty
