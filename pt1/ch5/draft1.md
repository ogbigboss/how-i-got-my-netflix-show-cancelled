# Chapter 5

### Summary

1. Ch 6 - Third week, C level no shows at C level intro immediately after I cover The Beatles' "Oh! Darling" followed by David Bowie's "The Man Who Sold the World" on my acoustic guitar, while singing. I didn't think my performance was that bad, even if you were listening over audio surveillance, as to not show up to the meeting about introing the C levels. They left the youngest C level to the meeting, and he had his face plum as a... plum, I guess. He was very red in the face. Later that evening, they cut my internet connection, again. I was rewatching _Death Note_, and this annoyed me, but it came back on shortly. The horror show begins as this forces me to finally look at my Boss' LinkedIn, and realizing the CEO not only held some good governemnt position with DC at some point, even worse, he may have attended college with my _sister_. Awful.
