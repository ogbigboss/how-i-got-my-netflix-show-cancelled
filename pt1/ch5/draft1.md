Computer programming ultimately boils down to asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?"

A CPU microchip is a bunch of transistors, which are more or less the same technology as an average light switch. Programming languages give you an abstract way to control these transistors, and how they react to input (keyboards, trackpads), how they respond via output (displays, speakers), and a whole lot of math in between that, at the level of most modern programming languages, you can take for granted.

So you're asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?" But in the format of `if`, `then`, and `else` keywords guiding other logic.

I've gotten used to it, but I often times think through, well, nearly everything that is not confirmable as fact through my head like a programmer.

```
if this_assumption_is_true then
  maybe_react_idk_thats_a_whole_other_question
else if this_assumption_is_false then
  definitely_dont_react_if_you_can_confirm_its_false
else if i_cannot_confirm_the_truth_either_way then
  try_and_gauge_others_reactions_with_measured_risk
end
```

Over the last year I've gotten used to it, and, considering the legal precedent I knew I may be possibly setting, I was willing to take quite a bit of measured risk.

...

My manager Eloise was on vacation that week, where on monday I had a 1:1 to get to know a new coworker, Damon Hastings. Damon was around my age or a bit older, but newer to development as he made a career change in his late 20s. Damon was very nice and I thought he was smarter than his confidence allowed, though that can happen to minorities in tech quite often. Either way Damon seemed very happy at Vouch.

However, somehow Rachel Bird came up, and Damon, whom if I recall correctly was sitting with his wife in a diner at the time working via the diner's wifi, let me know an interesting detail that Eloise hadn't about Rachel Bird's time at Vouch.

Apparently Rachel had been sexually harassed by not one but two employees; and one was still present at the company.

I had gathered via her linked in profile that Rachel was also like Damon a developer via a career change, and was in her 40s. I immediately asked myself:

`Whom in this company would hit on a woman in her 40s and get away with it even though one guy didn't`

I immediately thought of John Wallace, who had a loserly vibe to me. I rethought the chain of event's from John Wallace's perspective, if and only if he was a dork ass divorced loser.

```
if vouch_cio_john_wallace_is_a_dork then
  if john_hit_on_and_got_rejected_by_rachel_bird then
    if rachel_saw_it_as_harassment_and_took_two_months off then
      if rachel_quit_on_a_friday then
        if john_took_personal_offense_to_his_masculine_identity then
          john_reacted_by_playing_dumb_spy_games_with_me_and_the_government
        end
      end
    end
  end
else if i_cannot_prove_all_of_the_above
  best_not_to_say_anything_about_it
else if cio_john_wallace_is_not_a_dork_ass_loser
  im_guessing_this_wouldnt_have_happened_but_idk_i_could_be_wrong
end
```

The only problem here was I couldn't prove any of that -- it would just make sense given other information at hand, so I just kept it in mind for down the road, saying to myself that if things got weirder, a 40 year old divorced tech executive's ego making this a reality makes more sense than not.

Damon seemed happily married with kids, and was from the Oakland area. I tried giving him shit for the Warriors, but I think he was a Kings' fan. About that, I could be mistaken.

Tuesday, March 1st, 2022, was probably the day everything got worse.

I didn't really know what was going on and knew I would be perceived as rude if I were to be direct about it; but something about the conflict in Ukraine persisting made me feel like whatever was happening, it was _wrong_, and it was worth finding out more about before I became the part that was wrong and not just the victim.

In 2020, I had developed a set of techniques meant to decipher if my bosses are paying attention to what I am saying while my laptop is on mute while working from home. It works alarmingly well during meetings, especially if you're decent at reading faces on web cams, as anyone who spent a good amount of time watching live video streams on Twitch would.

I had been streaming for 3 years at the time of 2020 when I combined the skill of knowing how to pay attention in meetings even if I am distracted or talking to someone else with the skill of being able to read faces when they're on webcams that I learned via twitch, with a skill I've always had but never had quite developed for this purpose: talking shit, to some extent, ala the children in the movie _Sandlot_, though hopefully with less gender bias.

By 2022, I worked for 3 separate companies that I could not identify as using audio surveillance after the company I worked for in 2020 where I developed my techniques and felt that I had confirmed they were surveilling me. The fourth company was Vouch, and the techniques never worked better in my life than on Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

In my most private of moments, I call the main technique, with some reference to the film _Perdita Durango_ and the Lady Gaga song _Poker Face_, the "Gandolfini Germanotta I Hate Your Little Poker Face Move." But only in private.

The "GG move" works thusly:
