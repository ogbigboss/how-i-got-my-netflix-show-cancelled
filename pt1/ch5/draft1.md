Computer programming ultimately boils down to asking one question a lot: 

_Is this thing on?_

A CPU microchip is a bunch of transistors, which are more or less the same technology as an average light switch. Programming languages give you an abstract way to control these transistors, and how they react to input (keyboards, trackpads), how they respond via output (displays, speakers), and a whole lot of math in between that, at the level of most modern programming languages, you can take for granted.

So you're asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?" But in the format of `if`, `then`, and `else` keywords guiding other logic.

I've gotten used to it, but I often times think through, well, nearly everything that is not confirmable as fact through my head like a programmer.

```
if this_assumption_is_true then
  maybe_react_idk_thats_a_whole_other_question
else if this_assumption_is_false then
  definitely_dont_react_if_you_can_confirm_its_false
else if i_cannot_confirm_the_truth_either_way then
  try_and_gauge_others_reactions_with_measured_risk
end
```

Over the last year I've gotten used to it, and, considering the legal precedent I knew I may be possibly setting, I was willing to take quite a bit of measured risk.

...

My manager Eloise was on vacation that week, where on monday I had a 1:1 to get to know a new coworker, Damon Hastings. Damon was around my age or a bit older, but newer to development as he made a career change in his late 20s. Damon was very nice and I thought he was smarter than his confidence allowed, though that can happen to minorities in tech quite often. Either way Damon seemed very happy at Vouch.

However, somehow Rachel Bird came up, and Damon, whom if I recall correctly was sitting with his wife in a diner at the time working via the diner's wifi, let me know an interesting detail that Eloise hadn't about Rachel Bird's time at Vouch.

Apparently Rachel had been sexually harassed by not one but two employees; and one was still present at the company.

I had gathered via her linked in profile that Rachel was also like Damon a developer via a career change, and was in her 40s. I immediately asked myself:

`Whom in this company would hit on a woman in her 40s and get away with it even though one guy didn't`

I immediately thought of John Wallace, who had a loserly vibe to me. I rethought the chain of event's from John Wallace's perspective, if and only if he was a dork ass divorced loser.

```
if vouch_cio_john_wallace_is_a_dork then
  if john_hit_on_and_got_rejected_by_rachel_bird then
    if rachel_saw_it_as_harassment_and_took_two_months off then
      if rachel_quit_on_a_friday then
        if john_took_personal_offense_to_his_masculine_identity then
          john_reacted_by_playing_dumb_spy_games_with_me_and_the_government
        end
      end
    end
  end
else if i_cannot_prove_all_of_the_above
  best_not_to_say_anything_about_it
else if cio_john_wallace_is_not_a_dork_ass_loser
  im_guessing_this_wouldnt_have_happened_but_idk_i_could_be_wrong
end
```

The only problem here was I couldn't prove any of that -- it would just make sense given other information at hand, so I just kept it in mind for down the road, saying to myself that if things got weirder, a 40 year old divorced tech executive's ego making this a reality makes more sense than not.

Damon seemed happily married with kids, and was from the Oakland area. I tried giving him shit for the Warriors, but I think he was a Kings' fan. About that, I could be mistaken.

...

Tuesday, March 1st, 2022, was probably the day everything got worse.

I didn't really know what was going on and knew I would be perceived as rude if I were to be direct about it; but something about the conflict in Ukraine persisting made me feel like whatever was happening, it was _wrong_, and it was worth finding out more about before I became the part that was wrong and not just the victim.

...

In 2020, I had developed a set of techniques meant to decipher if my bosses are paying attention to what I am saying while my laptop is on mute while working from home. It works alarmingly well during meetings, especially if you're decent at reading faces on web cams, as anyone who spent a good amount of time watching live video streams on Twitch would.

I had been streaming for 3 years at the time of 2020 when I combined the skill of knowing how to pay attention in meetings even if I am distracted or talking to someone else with the skill of being able to read faces when they're on webcams that I learned via twitch, with a skill I've always had but never had quite developed for this purpose: talking shit, to some extent, ala the children in the movie _Sandlot_, though hopefully with less gender bias.

By 2022, I worked for 3 separate companies that I could not identify as using audio surveillance after the company I worked for in 2020 where I developed my techniques and felt that I had confirmed they were surveilling me. The fourth company was Vouch, and the techniques never worked better in my life than on Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

In my most private of moments, I call the main technique, with some reference to the film _Perdita Durango_ and the Lady Gaga song _Poker Face_, the "Gandolfini Germanotta I Hate Your Little Poker Face Move." But only in private.

The "GG move" works thusly:

```
function the_gg_move
  if you_are_in_a_remote_meeting and you_can_hide_your_face_and_mute_your_mic then
    if you_start_talking_random_shit then
      if you_say_some_generally_wild_out_of_place_for_a_meeting_shit then
        if someone_flinches_or_laughs_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_refutes_the_current_speaker then
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_someone_in_another_state_says_moments_before_they_do
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          your_tech_boss_thinks_youre_a_hacker_despite_the_tech_reasons_this_is_dumb
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

function evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
  if they_flinched_while_looking_away_from_the_meeting_on_their_screen then
    theres_a_likelihood_your_audio_is_being_converted_to_text_in_a_separate_window
  end

  if their_energy_changes_in_no_recognition_to_actual_meeting then
    theres_a_likelihood_youve_stolen_their_focus_from_the_meeting_and_they_feel_caught
  end

  if they_seem_uncomfortable then
    they_likely_feel_guilty_or_self_conscious_about_privacy_implications
  else if they_seem_excited then
    they_likely_are_excited_about_a_context_to_invade_others_privacy
  end
end
```

Let's break these two methods down.

First is `the_gg_move`, the main method, the thing. In a tele conference meeting while working from home, if you can hide your camera and mute your mic while others do the opposite, you can find out based on other's reactions how they are audio surveilling you. You basically talk out loud to find out whether the hardware honors the software, or, whether there is a separate program running on your and some of your co worker's machines that monitors your audio and converts it to text in real time so they can know what you're saying, without you knowing it's running.

It's key to note that this would happen in a separate piece of software than your Zoom or Google hangout meeting, most likely, which is to say, if `the_gg_move` feels effective in a meeting, it's more than possible that your mic is not muted and is transcribing whatever it hears into text as often as you or anyone, even your television, speaks out loud around it.

_Is this thing on?_

That's the technical side at least. Welcome to the future. The age old side is more fun, to me. Depending on what _kind_ of shit you talk, you will get different reactions, that reveal different things, given the awkward and new-to-human-evolutionary-existence vibe the social situation you're in has.

I keep saying legal precedent for a reason. I'm a nurture over nature guy, fwiw.

The easiest is to just say wild shit, like you might at a party, but certainly not in relation to the meeting. Maybe jokes about someone. If you can make them laugh, try and do so. This is fun but I have never had it turn out well, to be honest, when I get reactions.

The reactions are usually flinches that - and this is crucial - _would not matter to the normal meeting at hand._ Meaning you _have got to_ pay attention to the meeting. You should be able to take notes after, you paid that much attention.

The interesting side effect about `the_gg_move` is that I end up paying way more attention during meetings, in a way that even if I had my web cam on and mic off mute, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be nearly as aware. Regardless, the purpose of `the_gg_move` is not to pay better attention during meetings.

The purpose of `the_gg_move` is to decipher to what extent your employer is utilizing digital audio surveillance on your devices while you work from home.

Anyway, if you talk wild shit, try and keep it funny, and you should get someone to laugh. The concept alone is funny, and many will get it - _this new employee is clearly trying to figure out if they're being audio surveilled by doing basic stand up comedy routines_ - just keep it as family friendly as possible and well, you should see someone laugh.

It helps to feel confident in being funny outside of this situation though, I'll allow.

The other thing is to _directly refute what is being said_. At times, the speaker will be a leader who has the audio surveillance text window open, and those reactions are the easiest to gauge. Did they lose their speaking cadence? Did they feel threatened?

Even if they didn't react themselves, this is still useful to gauge other people's reactions. At any rate it's important to try and keep your refutations in line with your own honest opinions, and it's _doubly_ important to, if they continue speaking and touch upon your complaint in a way that your complaint is no longer valid -- take the time to recognize that, actually, you were mistaken a moment ago.

You never know who's listening, but still, we all have disagreements on procedures at work places that we hold back in politeness. One way audio surveillance is not very polite, in my opinion, but it's a separate conflict from the one you're stirring up, so it's best to be clear when you're in the wrong, to deliver the best message.

After the flinch, in `evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard`, gauge their emotional state as best you can. Do they feel caught? Does this make them feel threatened, or excited? And finally, last, but not least, and basically generally applicable to any and every office situation:

Who are they and what do they mean to the company hierarchy?

I'd write that in the code but I figure'd it's obvious enough, just between us humans.

...

Vouch held company "all hands" meetings every Tuesday, meetings where the entire company gathered to hear updates from mostly leadership but also others within the company as well. You probably do something similar at your work place, if maybe at a different cadence. Vouch being a smallish, largely remote, under 100 employee company at the time, this was easy enough to do every week.

The first two weeks I mostly listened and didn't really run `the_gg_move`, but on that Tuesday, if I had roommates I'm sure they would have wondered why I was talking out loud while my speakers were clearly playing audio of my co workers speaking out loud in a meeting, and it sounds like we're having two separate conversations, albeit at times where it feels like both are listening to each other cautiously such to wonder if that group of people and or weird guy over there is listening to me or them, respectively.

But, I don't have room mates, and like I said, this isn't a normative human social situation; it's something new.

So anyway, March 1 2022 I was talking a lot of shit, refuting people at times, and getting a ton of reactions. I was pretty certain that at least the C levels were listening.

Not shocked given all that the last few weeks hinted at, I generally just kept talking.

At some point, I must've ran out of things to say. My more... base... human instincts must have caused me to react in such a way that I just starting saying, well, general things that would make sense in a casual way, without any real significance.

New employees just starting that week were being introduced. I soon saw a brown skinned man with a solid hair style on my screen. He took a moment to speak, which, gave me a pause to say something while being able to evaluate better if I was being listened to given there was no other stimuli to react to.

But, like I was saying, I think I ran out of things to say, so I just said something like

> "Alright then..."

I really can't remember other than that it was extremely... colloquial? And appropriate? For anyone in that situation, to say, really.

Three people shared the screen at the time, a google hangout managed whom showed up and who didn't based on previous speakers.

An HR person introducing the new employees was there, and the CEO Sam Hodges was also there as they had both spoken recently, and finally, the new brown skinned employee was on the screen.

The new guy spoke, and on my end, this was mere moments -- as a guy that considers game development and music hobbies, this may seem weird but -- maybe about 350 ms after I said what was quoted above, the new guy then began to speak:

> "Alright then..."

The HR person gave less reaction than the CEO, whom nearly choked on something they weren't eating at the moment if I recall. They both flinched, but one flinched way harder. The new guy didn't, and kept talking like things were normal, indicating only two were audio surveilling me.

I'll admit - it was kind of weird. I wondered if I was psychic. I realized if I was, I would've never taken this job.

My instinct was to accuse the flinchers of rascism, which, was stupid, and was just a way to talk random shit to buy time and gauge reactions while I considered what they _might_ think, and well, somewhere inside I sighed.

_They might think that somehow I "hacked" the meeting to know what he was going to say and that I'm showing off._

That's... impossible. I was in New York, I think taht guy was in the midwest, several people were spread across the country. I'd have to somehow be able to remotely delay the new guy's signal such that I could hear it first, fully interpret it, and then time everything appropriately, somehow. Without leaving a massive trail of evidence, if not working in tandem with several actors and at any rate... what kind of a person would do something like that?

To show off? What kind of a person capable of the above would just... show off with it?

Would these people _really_ think I'm some kind of Netflix inspired cartoon brought to life in human form, a television hallucination of a villain with magical hacking super powers?

_No, that's stupid. Surely, if they're flinching because this is some weird group investigation -- which, by the way, is weird! how many people know about this? the HR person?? -- then that means they'll eventually talk to actual technical folks who could explain that its impossible for me to do that, and maybe even just a few I don't know normal police detectives who might explain that I'd be a stupid criminal to do so and would've gotten caught on something long before I pulled off something so complex._

Or something, it was a trail of thoughts I had while calling people rascist for, well, reasons they weren't actually rascist for. It was a weird moment. The fact that the guy was brown, and had a solid hair style, two things I share with him, were in fact coincidences. At least at the time.

I'm _pretty_ sure I corrected myself on the rascist accusations, though, it wasn't the top most thing I tried to remember that day. I do remember attempting to address why I'm nor is anyone capable of "hacking" such to make that minor miracle happen. I didn't fully insinuate it was probably god doing it just to literally try and manufacture a situation where this shit gets so sideways somehow we never do it again while doing the least harm, but, mysterious ways get confused for technology in tech startups all the time - it's a big part of the financing structure!

Somewhat after that moment, while the HR person and the CEO were the only two people on the screen, the CEO, in a planned statement, reminded everyone of the company motto. That's to say I do not think he really thought of the motto in the context of audio surveilling an employee into a bogus federal investigation, but, he said what he said when he said something like:

> "When it comes to our employees at Vouch, we strive to live by the golden rule."

Near immediately, and in the hope that the audio transcription picked up my sudden falsetto, I responded directly:

> "You have me under audio surveillance!"

The HR person flinched and looked away, pain and shame in their eyes. I'm still not sure why they were involved to _that_ extent, given their lack of seniority within the company, but maybe given this new social situation, new expectations are arising for the average HR worker.

I'd recommend they watch _Burn Notice_, personally! But, maybe HR workers don't have to audio surveil the workforce in the future, that could be a thing too. It's a leap from making sure the company benefits package is properly executed, and I don't think there's much overlap in the trainings involved.

The CEO didn't flinch as much, but I saw his eyes tick to the side where I presume a chat window of some sort was transcribing my audio.

At some point, the CEO called on the CIO, John Wallace, directly. Wallace seemed a bit surprised -- this wasn't planned -- and appeared to shift his body to only show half of his face. I felt a bit of tension in the CEO when he called on John, as though he wanted to make a point that well, he was the leader, who could at any point call on anyone in the company and ask them to speak, even if they didn't plan it before.

Maybe the CEO was tense for other reasons. It just felt a bit competitive.

Either way, the CIO John Wallace answered the question as best he could, but in my opinion, while hiding half his face he also had an _excited_ cadence that didn't match up to what he was talking about entirely.

I began to wonder if my earlier suspicions about him could be true, but, to be honest, not that much.

_It's not like I could confirm at that moment that he literally got divorced recently, such to give him motivation to be gossipping about me in a way that led to a federal investigation such so he could feel dominant once again after potentially being rejected by a woman who recently quit._

Well, I still can't confirm _all_ of that, and at the time I coudln't confirm any of it, but it was a thought in my head, however fleeting.

I left the meeting feeling certain that, eventually, once these idiots found out I was joking, they'd fire me. I couldn't confirm that wouldn't happen at that point, but I can tell you that in the end, it was I who quit Vouch, and this meeting probably should have been when I did. Alas.

...

After that meeting, around an hour or two later, it was time to finally meet the C levels in a meeting that was cancelled two weeks ago.

I still wasn't _positive_ anything weird actually happened int he last all hands meeting that day. Maybe, I was just connecting odd occurences.

Only one way to find out, and I needed a break to relax. With about 15 minutes til the next meeting, I picked up my guitar and played. Thinking on it, it feels just like yesterday. I would've been better off getting on my knees and praying, but at least I didn't get fooled again.

Wait, who? Huh? No, no, I actually don't know enough of their songs.

I decided to play two songs by my laptop, that I had been practicing to some extent, while singing. I made some alterations to the lyrics of The Beatles' `Oh! Darling`, as well as David Bowie's `The Man Who Sold The World`, thinking the first could have a neat line about listening, and the second could really test out the theory of whether or not my bosses actually thought I was some kind of hacker that only exists in movies, such that I "sold the world", and can also play guitar, and sing, while looking insanely good doing it, _and_ specialize in a style of code that doesnt really involve hacking much?

I mean, it would have to be too much right? They'd... get it, right?

Maybe I should've also impressed them on my film knowledge.

Anyway, I had a cover of `Oh! Darling` I was working on about a fifth or a fourth down from where McCartney recorded it at. Pretty sure I pitched the Bowie song up a key. In the opening lines of `Oh! Darling`, I sang this, with some musical emphasis involving a quick drop out of my guitar.

> "Ohhh Darling.... if you're listening."

I think I may have growled a bit with the listening part. I was kind of pissed, sure, but, I was also in character! Also the song involves a lot of oxygen so I think I got caught in two places. But I digress, the song continues

> "I will never do you no harm... believe me when I tell you... I will never do you no harm"

Which, fuck me, I thought might be a cute way to say I'm not doing you any harm you dumb weird fucking people. Without the last bit.

I kept the lyrics to the Bowie song straight forward.

I'm not... bad... at guitar. I'm not a great singer. But I can sing, not well, and play somewhat complicated riffs at the same time. I'm not like, John Mayer or something, but I also don't practice. I remember being fairly artful with my arrangement of `The Man Who Sold The World` and, based on the meeting, I wondered if they hypothesized there were two people in the room, as I couldn't confirm as video surveillance was occurring?

I probably could've picked a simpler song, like `My Generation` maybe, but hopefully there's never a next time.

Anyway, if they thought I was more than one person, even just that day, it's one of the better explanations as to why 3 out of the 4 C levels present in the earlier day's all hands meeting would miss the meeting specifically meant to introduce themselves as leaders of a small company to incoming employees, especially a meeting that was cancelled in it's first week and thus representing not just one but two whole batches of new employees.

It also explains why the one C level "thrown to the wolf" was the youngest, Travis Hedge, someone with a family legacy in the insurance industry and along with the CEO a co founder of Vouch. I had met with him in a previous onbaording meeting and had some back and forth dialogue; I thought he was an ok guy and after hearing him talk in that and other meetings, I had established a baseline for his cadence.

It wasn't to be redder in the face than a tomato in the sun, at least for a paleish white guy, who wasn't normally so flush.

I think he may have seen me recognize that, and immediately offered that his wife was locked outside his house and he just had to run to get the door.

He took a moment and I thought _that's a pretty solid way to explain why you're gonna be red in the face on the way back, but not at the start of this meeting, but, yeah_.

When he was back he was a bit short in breath in a way he wasn't at the start of the meeting, something that didn't suprise me.

I handled the meeting normally, camera and mic recording me for the rest of the group. I was patient and eventually engaged Travis, the sole C level present, in light conversation, mostly to ease his tension, and in the format of easy softball "hey what's this company do" questions that may be helpful for the whole group to hear.

Mostly so he could calm down and stop being so red in the face, which he did quickly.

I wish the other C levels had shown; I think they felt ashamed at not doing so given how differently I handle, well, being in meetings where I consent to being seen and heard.

...

That evening, I continued my fourth re watch of the Anime classic _Death Note_. I'm sorry if that's lame to you, or if you don't know what that is.

(nts: check text and notes) At around 7:30 PM that evening, right when I was habitually "signing off" after work, my internet went down again, and I was streaming via Netflix at the time, to my present day dismay (I now prefer the disc format). The last time it went down, it was at the start of my workday. Now the opposite.

I expressed annoyance to my laptop, saying this was lame, or something to that extent. I felt more hassled than harrassed at that moment, but the law is grey on such things I suppose.

In 5 minutes or so, my internet connection came back on, though Spectrum took an hour to text me about it while telling me immediately when it went down.

I didn't care, I just went back to _Death Note_.

At some point soon I couldn't focus -- the show involves police and, well, my life probably did at that point in some way as well. I realized it was probably time to do the one thing I hadn't done, on purpose.

I really wanted Vouch to be a place where I could _ignore_ their ineffeciencies, which abound in big tech, in order to pay my debts and balance my life out a bit. That didn't turn out to be possible. However, in that effort, when joining I astutely did absolutely zero research on the "company leadership."

All I knew about them before joining was that the one CFO from another company whose offer I declined seemed impressed enough by Vouch's CEO, which spoke highly to me.

_So who are my bosses anyway?_

To LinkedIn I went.
