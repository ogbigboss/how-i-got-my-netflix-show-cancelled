Computer programming ultimately boils down to asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?"

A CPU microchip is a bunch of transistors, which are more or less the same technology as an average light switch. Programming languages give you an abstract way to control these transistors, and how they react to input (keyboards, trackpads), how they respond via output (displays, speakers), and a whole lot of math in between that, at the level of most modern programming languages, you can take for granted.

So you're asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?" But in the format of `if`, `then`, and `else` keywords guiding other logic.

I've gotten used to it, but I often times think through, well, nearly everything that is not confirmable as fact through my head like a programmer.

```
if this_assumption_is_true then
  maybe_react_idk_thats_a_whole_other_question
else if this_assumption_is_false then
  definitely_dont_react_if_you_can_confirm_its_false
else if i_cannot_confirm_the_truth_either_way then
  try_and_gauge_others_reactions_with_measured_risk
end
```

Over the last year I've gotten used to it, and, considering the legal precedent I knew I may be possibly setting, I was willing to take quite a bit of measured risk.
