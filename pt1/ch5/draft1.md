Computer programming ultimately boils down to asking one question a lot: 

_Is this thing on?_

A CPU microchip is a bunch of transistors, which are more or less the same technology as an average light switch. Programming languages give you an abstract way to control these transistors, and how they react to input (keyboards, trackpads), how they respond via output (displays, speakers), and a whole lot of math in between that, at the level of most modern programming languages, you can take for granted.

So you're asking one question a lot: "Is this thing on?" But in the format of `if`, `then`, and `else` keywords guiding other logic.

I've gotten used to it, but I often times think through, well, nearly everything that is not confirmable as fact through my head like a programmer.

```
if this_assumption_is_true then
  maybe_react_idk_thats_a_whole_other_question
else if this_assumption_is_false then
  definitely_dont_react_if_you_can_confirm_its_false
else if i_cannot_confirm_the_truth_either_way then
  try_and_gauge_others_reactions_with_measured_risk
end
```

Over the last year I've gotten used to it, and, considering the legal precedent I knew I may be possibly setting, I was willing to take quite a bit of measured risk.

...

My manager Eloise was on vacation that week, where on monday I had a 1:1 to get to know a new coworker, Damon Hastings. Damon was around my age or a bit older, but newer to development as he made a career change in his late 20s. Damon was very nice and I thought he was smarter than his confidence allowed, though that can happen to minorities in tech quite often. Either way Damon seemed very happy at Vouch.

However, somehow Rachel Bird came up, and Damon, whom if I recall correctly was sitting with his wife in a diner at the time working via the diner's wifi, let me know an interesting detail that Eloise hadn't about Rachel Bird's time at Vouch.

Apparently Rachel had been sexually harassed by not one but two employees; and one was still present at the company.

I had gathered via her linked in profile that Rachel was also like Damon a developer via a career change, and was in her 40s. I immediately asked myself:

`Whom in this company would hit on a woman in her 40s and get away with it even though one guy didn't`

I immediately thought of John Wallace, who had a loserly vibe to me. I rethought the chain of event's from John Wallace's perspective, if and only if he was a dork ass divorced loser.

```
if vouch_cio_john_wallace_is_a_dork then
  if john_hit_on_and_got_rejected_by_rachel_bird then
    if rachel_saw_it_as_harassment_and_took_two_months off then
      if rachel_quit_on_a_friday then
        if john_took_personal_offense_to_his_masculine_identity then
          john_reacted_by_playing_dumb_spy_games_with_me_and_the_government
        end
      end
    end
  end
else if i_cannot_prove_all_of_the_above
  best_not_to_say_anything_about_it
else if cio_john_wallace_is_not_a_dork_ass_loser
  im_guessing_this_wouldnt_have_happened_but_idk_i_could_be_wrong
end
```

The only problem here was I couldn't prove any of that -- it would just make sense given other information at hand, so I just kept it in mind for down the road, saying to myself that if things got weirder, a 40 year old divorced tech executive's ego making this a reality makes more sense than not.

Damon seemed happily married with kids, and was from the Oakland area. I tried giving him shit for the Warriors, but I think he was a Kings' fan. About that, I could be mistaken.

...

Tuesday, March 1st, 2022, was probably the day everything got worse.

I didn't really know what was going on and knew I would be perceived as rude if I were to be direct about it; but something about the conflict in Ukraine persisting made me feel like whatever was happening, it was _wrong_, and it was worth finding out more about before I became the part that was wrong and not just the victim.

...

In 2020, I had developed a set of techniques meant to decipher if my bosses are paying attention to what I am saying while my laptop is on mute while working from home. It works alarmingly well during meetings, especially if you're decent at reading faces on web cams, as anyone who spent a good amount of time watching live video streams on Twitch would.

I had been streaming for 3 years at the time of 2020 when I combined the skill of knowing how to pay attention in meetings even if I am distracted or talking to someone else with the skill of being able to read faces when they're on webcams that I learned via twitch, with a skill I've always had but never had quite developed for this purpose: talking shit, to some extent, ala the children in the movie _Sandlot_, though hopefully with less gender bias.

By 2022, I worked for 3 separate companies that I could not identify as using audio surveillance after the company I worked for in 2020 where I developed my techniques and felt that I had confirmed they were surveilling me. The fourth company was Vouch, and the techniques never worked better in my life than on Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

In my most private of moments, I call the main technique, with some reference to the film _Perdita Durango_ and the Lady Gaga song _Poker Face_, the "Gandolfini Germanotta I Hate Your Little Poker Face Move." But only in private.

The "GG move" works thusly:

```
function the_gg_move
  if you_are_in_a_remote_meeting and you_can_hide_your_face_and_mute_your_mic then
    if you_start_talking_random_shit then
      if you_say_some_generally_wild_out_of_place_for_a_meeting_shit then
        if someone_flinches_or_laughs_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_refutes_the_current_speaker then
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
        end
      else if you_say_something_that_someone_in_another_state_says_moments_before_they_do
        if someone_flinches_such_to_suggest_they_heard then
          your_tech_boss_thinks_youre_a_hacker_despite_the_tech_reasons_this_is_dumb
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

function evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard
  if they_flinched_while_looking_away_from_the_meeting_on_their_screen then
    theres_a_likelihood_your_audio_is_being_converted_to_text_in_a_separate_window
  end

  if their_energy_changes_in_no_recognition_to_actual_meeting then
    theres_a_likelihood_youve_stolen_their_focus_from_the_meeting_and_they_feel_caught
  end

  if they_seem_uncomfortable then
    they_likely_feel_guilty_or_self_conscious_about_privacy_implications
  else if they_seem_excited then
    they_likely_are_excited_about_a_context_to_invade_others_privacy
  end
end
```

Let's break these two methods down.

First is `the_gg_move`, the main method, the thing. In a tele conference meeting while working from home, if you can hide your camera and mute your mic while others do the opposite, you can find out based on other's reactions how they are audio surveilling you. You basically talk out loud to find out whether the hardware honors the software, or, whether there is a separate program running on your and some of your co worker's machines that monitors your audio and converts it to text in real time so they can know what you're saying, without you knowing it's running.

It's key to note that this would happen in a separate piece of software than your Zoom or Google hangout meeting, most likely, which is to say, if `the_gg_move` feels effective in a meeting, it's more than possible that your mic is not muted and is transcribing whatever it hears into text as often as you or anyone, even your television, speaks out loud around it.

_Is this thing on?_

That's the technical side at least. Welcome to the future. The age old side is more fun, to me. Depending on what _kind_ of shit you talk, you will get different reactions, that reveal different things, given the awkward and new-to-human-evolutionary-existence vibe the social situation you're in has.

I keep saying legal precedent for a reason. I'm a nurture over nature guy, fwiw.

The easiest is to just say wild shit, like you might at a party, but certainly not in relation to the meeting. Maybe jokes about someone. If you can make them laugh, try and do so. This is fun but I have never had it turn out well, to be honest, when I get reactions.

The reactions are usually flinches that - and this is crucial - _would not matter to the normal meeting at hand._ Meaning you _have got to_ pay attention to the meeting. You should be able to take notes after, you paid that much attention.

The interesting side effect about `the_gg_move` is that I end up paying way more attention during meetings, in a way that even if I had my web cam on and mic off mute, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be nearly as aware. Regardless, the purpose of `the_gg_move` is not to pay better attention during meetings.

The purpose of `the_gg_move` is to decipher to what extent your employer is utilizing digital audio surveillance on your devices while you work from home.

Anyway, if you talk wild shit, try and keep it funny, and you should get someone to laugh. The concept alone is funny, and many will get it - _this new employee is clearly trying to figure out if they're being audio surveilled by doing basic stand up comedy routines_ - just keep it as family friendly as possible and well, you should see someone laugh.

It helps to feel confident in being funny outside of this situation though, I'll allow.

The other thing is to _directly refute what is being said_. At times, the speaker will be a leader who has the audio surveillance text window open, and those reactions are the easiest to gauge. Did they lose their speaking cadence? Did they feel threatened?

Even if they didn't react themselves, this is still useful to gauge other people's reactions. At any rate it's important to try and keep your refutations in line with your own honest opinions, and it's _doubly_ important to, if they continue speaking and touch upon your complaint in a way that your complaint is no longer valid -- take the time to recognize that, actually, you were mistaken a moment ago.

You never know who's listening, but still, we all have disagreements on procedures at work places that we hold back in politeness. One way audio surveillance is not very polite, in my opinion, but it's a separate conflict from the one you're stirring up, so it's best to be clear when you're in the wrong, to deliver the best message.

After the flinch, in `evaluate_how_they_may_have_heard`, gauge their emotional state as best you can. Do they feel caught? Does this make them feel threatened, or excited? And finally, last, but not least, and basically generally applicable to any and every office situation:

Who are they and what do they mean to the company hierarchy?

I'd write that in the code but I figure'd it's obvious enough, just between us humans.

...

Vouch held company "all hands" meetings every Tuesday, meetings where the entire company gathered to hear updates from mostly leadership but also others within the company as well. You probably do something similar at your work place, if maybe at a different cadence. Vouch being a smallish, largely remote, under 100 employee company at the time, this was easy enough to do every week.
