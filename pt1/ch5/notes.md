# Chapter 5 - Third Week at Vouch, 2/28 - 3/1

### Notes

1. Monday - sent xfiles theme (covered in previous chapter), 
1. Monday / Tuesday - 1:1 meeting with Damon Hastings, he reveals taht Rachel Bird had two sexual harrassers, one of which is still at the company. Given that Rachel was in her early 40s / late 30s, I assume this had to be an older person, given both her age as well as the fact that they were still at the company. I felt the most "loserish singledom" while still being a "powerful person" in the aura of John Wallace, a man who seemed to be running away from me in meetings.
1. Tuesday - All hands meeting afterwards, saying something as an indian man that another indian man said possibly at the same time, flinching, assuming they think I'm a mega hacker because of a simple twist of fate, responding to Hodges' bringing up the company standard of the "golden rule" (treat others as you would wish them to treat yourself) by shouting out "you have me on audio surveillance!" Look if I could audio surveil my bosses right back, maybe I'd be ok with this. Rajat seemed to be "eating" while filmed, I don't know what he meant by this if anything, had to be a communication because it was too unprofessional for a CPO at an all hands, IMO. John Wallace seemed surpirsed to be called on by Hodges to speak, and made sure to hide half his face on his webcam when doing so. It felt like an HR person was aware as well, which kind of offended me if true, but was just based on a suspicion based on reading faces.
1. Tuesday - After all hands was a scheduled "meet the C level" meeting which was canceled my first week. I was suspicious of that cancellation and I was suspicious of the previous day's all hands meeting so, to test for reactions, I played my guitar and sang two covers, first the Beatles' _Oh! Darling_ and David Bowie's _The Man Who Sold The World_, understanding the implications if and only if they thouhgt I was some weird super criminal, and thought why not. 3 out of the 4 C levels that _were_ at the all hands previously all of a sudden weren't at the next meeting. I didn't think my performance was that bad, even if you were listening over audio surveillance, as to not show up to the meeting about introing the C levels. They left the youngest C level to the meeting, and he had his face plum as a... plum, I guess. He was very red in the face. Later that evening, they cut my internet connection, again. I was rewatching _Death Note_, and this annoyed me, but it came back on shortly. The horror show begins as this forces me to finally look at my Boss' LinkedIn, and realizing the CEO not only held some good governemnt position with DC at some point, even worse, he may have attended college with my _sister_. Awful.
