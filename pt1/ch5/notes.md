# Chapter 5 - Third Week at Vouch, 2/28

### Notes

1. Monday - sent xfiles theme (covered in previous chapter), all hands meeting afterwards, saying something as an indian man that another indian man said possibly at the same time, flinching, assuming they think I'm a mega hacker because of a simple twist of fate, responding to Hodges' bringing up the company standard of the "golden rule" (treat others as you would wish them to treat yourself) by shouting out "you have me on audio surveillance!" Look if I could audio surveil my bosses right back, maybe I'd be ok with this.
1. Tuesday - I didn't think my performance was that bad, even if you were listening over audio surveillance, as to not show up to the meeting about introing the C levels. They left the youngest C level to the meeting, and he had his face plum as a... plum, I guess. He was very red in the face. Later that evening, they cut my internet connection, again. I was rewatching _Death Note_, and this annoyed me, but it came back on shortly. The horror show begins as this forces me to finally look at my Boss' LinkedIn, and realizing the CEO not only held some good governemnt position with DC at some point, even worse, he may have attended college with my _sister_. Awful.
1. Wednesday - Friday - Rental cars start showing up across the street under the FDR, freshly washed, of different sizes, some seem to bulge past their normal make size. Sure, I watch a lot of _Burn Notice_, but if those cars _were_ retrofitted to be armored then... well... uhm... and my boss was a part of the Obama admin technically well... uhm... what type of representatives from this country would rent cards _and_ possibly show up in armored vehicles as well? It was a fantasy, but I remember this was the first time I thought of the WH admin being involved via the SS (secret service) and coordinating with NYPD as they often do. I remember thinking: _That's fucking wild. That would only prove itself true if this thing gets more dipshitted and somehow continues past this one job, so it's probably best to not think about._
