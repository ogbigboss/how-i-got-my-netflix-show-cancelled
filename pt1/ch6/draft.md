# Chapter 6 - Third Week at Vouch, 3/2 on

> "You ever meet someone, and it just seems to click instantly? You like the same things, share the same opinions - it seems lke you've known them your whole life. It could be fate, or it could be that you have a listening device planted under the dashbaord of your car." - Jeffrey Donovan narrating as Michael Westen from Broadcast TV's _Burn Notice_

Wednesday at work was fairly normal. I had code to look at, so I looked. There were some other meetings that didn't feel too weird.

However, in my apartment in New York City, on the edge of the East River, and a street away from the FDR underpass, something strange started happening.

The underpass below the FDR, directly across the street from me and the easiest thing to view that's not the river itself once you exit the building, has three sections. On the left is the FDNY section, which is used primarily for EMS vehicles. During the 2020 COVID lockdown, it was busy moving the sick and the dead. On the right is a DSNY section, which also I believe houses a maintanence crew for city vehicles in general, but mostly sanitation cars moved in that area.

In the middle was an unmarked area. Later in 2020 during the George Floyd protests, this area was flooded with unmarked vans. I'm pretty it's for the cops.

About 6 or 7 years ago, it was empty under there. You could even park if you had a car and nothing would be there to stop you.

In 2022, starting to my recollection on March 2nd 2022, I started to see something that became a regular theme over the next few weeks and into the spring: rental cars, primarily but not entirely focused on parking in the "middle" section.

I've seen cop cars park there, sometimes. Unmarked vehicles, often. But rental cars have a... "I was just cleaned" look to them.

I sighed and figure'd that last night's research couldn't have been too far off: _only out of towners would rent cars, and only law enforcement should be able to park in that area, and only out of town law enforcement would focus on renting mostly black, american vehicles given domestic discounts._

And, if I was wrong, well, then nothing else weird would happen.

...

Thursday, the new guy whom I had shared words with though we never spoke, shared his bio with the rest of the company, as did all the other new employees that week.

Almost magically, he would fill out the rest of the band I'm not in - he played drums and bass. Wow. I play guitar and sing! And we're both brown guys!

... did they think we'd be friends?

Under more normal circumstances, I may have reached out and said something. But he wasn't in my department, nor a programmer of any kind, so we had no real context to talk about those things, though I had with other employees in my department.

Normally I wouldn't pay attention to any of that being a sign of subterfuge _just because the guy's brown skinned and I am to_... but I did begin to wonder if the CEO flinched as hard as he did because yes, the guy was hired here to try and "feel me out."

I forget his name, but weeks later I would look him up on linked in as well. Apparently, he went to college with the company's head of security, a young man named Cody who was hired shortly before I was and seemed to have a background in "digital security." I also noted the new guy's resume had little to say about business insurance, and seemed fairly entry level.

Did the newly hired digital security guy ask his one college buddy to join a company and play up a musical inclination to... feel me out?

It'd be weird if so.

But I've also never seen a CEO with such a stellar reputation flinch as hard at anything as I saw Hodges flinch two days ago.

It's probably just a coicidence.
