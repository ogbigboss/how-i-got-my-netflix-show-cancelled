# Chapter 9 - First Week post Vouch, 3/21/22

### Notes

#### Sunday

Head to Legacy. Store is empty, right as I walk in, `How Do U Want it` by Tupac Shakur starts playing, but that might've been fate. Shahim, guy I usually see at the store, is manning the front, and is saying "copycat" after saying "copy that" the previous week as I walk in. I ask him about that almost immediately and he seems weirded out, like I caught him in something. I did that on purpose, to make him feel that way.

Anyway, I leave the store and there was the biker cop guy who did the cop stop thing. Look up how other people describe the "cop stop" move, I don't know if I really am making sense. I'm sure I can rephrase something else.

As he did it, no one else got arrested, the guy in question, asian dude in a blue denim jacket in jeans with a matching wash and a tight ponytail, right by the school on broome and essex (nts: check streets). There seemed to be some cars waiting to my left and a guy waiting to my right that may have been involved, guy on the right laughed into a phone as I looked at him

I email the lawyer about it and BCcd my sister the chain so she was aware of my comms with their lawyer -- it was the chain including the emails with the lawyer refusing to let me talk to their security person after being told my machine was "hacked" etc. I play up the idea of this being uhh weird because essentially it seems NYPD are trying to "intimidate" me, and... y'all are some democrats, huh? I intimiate being more intimidated than I was in the email. Whatever.

#### Tuesday

Therapist appoinment - up to that point I hadn't told my therapist anything, but figure'd since I was porbably still being survilled, and the government might try to do some weird thing to cover this up and smear me, I thoguht one of the better ways to get ahead of that would be to tell my therapist whom I was having online appoinments with.

I gave my therapist a condensed version of what you've read, skipping the prefaces already spoken on in previous appointments. Therapist seems stunned and sympathetic, not sure what to say, but definitely sorry about it. I ask for a second appointment because well, I still had a few more details, but mostly, I was also depressed.

I think leaving therapy at that for now would be good, just make it clear from that point on you weren't using therapy as a way to do any other thing than leave digital breadcrumbs of what I think actually happened to prevent, say, something else happening that would require another version of the truth to be told before mine could be. Haven't been able to get out of that one.

#### Wednesday

Pretty sure the woman I refer to as "couch girl" helped me get my couch on time when I almost missed it. It made me think that, well, a normal person wouldn't do that, and if they were involved, maybe just maybe, some of these people weren't all god awful human beings. I'm pretty sure in retrospect they may have worked on the TV show I didn't realize I was on.

#### Thursday

Fedex'd Vouch's laptop back in strange box. Describe weird comms with shipping - you offered to ship, but they insisted on me shipping the laptop back in their own box. Tracking code when receiving the box went through california to utah to chicago adn tehn finally to NYC. Not terribly direct, took awhile, didn't include room for the charger which I just threw out, and strangely was routed through each of the locations to where the C Suite men lived, whcih I thought was funny. Like they didn't trust each other and they all had to take turns checking out the magic box to make sure.

I assume there was some sort of faraday lining in the box or something. I leave it with the lobby person Thursday, I see someone in the lobby, about my height and build, late 40s but slick healthy gray hair in a ponytail, light brown leather jacket waiting there. As I get back to my eighth floor apartment and look out the window, I see him and I'm pretty sure he's holding the box I gave to the lobby guy and told to give to the fedex guy. I didn't see a fedex logo in that leather jacket. Looked like he could've been a "hacker" type.

#### Friday

Reached out to LR after deciding to quit Vouch -- were they still interested in hiring me based on an offer in late January now that it was late March? Sean Carr + Sirishalal Rajput, my boss's boss and my boss had I joined, had a interview wiht me to ask what happened at Vouch. I told them they had too many developers, but also I alluded to a situation where "I was being gossipped" about. I told them it was fine by me if they reached out to Vouch to ask about it. But the real point to make here is that I literally said to Sean and Siri that "look, i'm just a lot more perceptive than people give me credit for and sometimes it gets me into trouble. I'm really good at knowing when people are talking about me and I'd appreciate it if, as my potential new managers, you two could be extra sensitive to the idea of me being more perceptive than your average straight male." Or something to that extent; but the intent and message was there. I now wonder what Vouch may have told LR to cover even for the idea of "gossip" which most certainly was happening on TOP of the investigation, which I didn't mention, but I'm sure LR heard about eventually. Anyway.

#### Saturday

Not 100% but pretty sure thsi was the day a very large ship of some sort came to pick up that weird radio barge thing. THe radio barge had an engine just to get it off the dock and no room for anything more, which, I thought was intriguing. Eventually the boat comes up to it and ties it to it's side.

However, the dockside had like, at least 10-15 Navy people, in uniform. The odd thing about it, was that, instead of looking behind them at the _gorgeous_ day it was (I remember the weather at least), and looking at say, the Manhattan Bridge, or say, Dumbo, or, I don't know, anything iconic, or say, since there were 15 of them or so, maybe looking in multiple directions?

All I know is when I stepped out onto my porch thing, it felt like everyone's shoulders were pointed right at me. No one like, pointed, at me, and maybe they were looking at my building.

275 South St? Or the Manhattan Bridge?

I knew why they were looking at me - it's because they all heard _something_ about me.

I shook my head -- how in the fuck could they have played this one that loose?

Look at the iconic bridge you morons, I'm trying to not lose my shit here (sorry Navy guys, just disavow it's fine).

Internally I just hoped this would all blow over, particularly if Liveramp hired me, and especially given what I told them in the meeting yesterday.
