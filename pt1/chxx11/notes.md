# Chapter 10 - Second Week post Vouch, 3/27/22

### Notes

#### Monday

I leave the laptop box with the lobby person, I see someone in the lobby, about my height and build, late 40s but slick healthy gray hair in a ponytail, light brown leather jacket waiting there. As I get back to my eighth floor apartment and look out the window, I see him and I'm pretty sure he's holding the box I gave to the lobby guy and told to give to the fedex guy. I didn't see a fedex logo in that leather jacket. Looked like he could've been a "hacker" type.

#### Wednesday

I have a therapist's appoinment and I, as an explanation as to why I did what I did, referenced _Burn Notice_, and said maybe I got some ideas from that show. I did that because I was more than certain I was under at least long term surveillance and I knew someone out there would know the show and find it funny. This was, of course, a horrifying miscalculation on my part. Pretty sure this gave someone the great idea that I was literally "delusional" based on what I watch on Television, which, well, if loving _Burn Notice_ is delusional, please don't tell anyone about how often I've quoted it in this book.

#### Thursday

Unfortunately all that "lying to the therapist in order to protect myself from being potentially federally smeared" made me "forget about my actual emotions" and I started to experience geniuine suicidal ideations, largely due to... the situation I was in. I have techniques to deal with this, but, they're not easy, and maybe I let myself slip a bit on purpose as I knew while being watched it would set a better precedent. I definitely thought experiencing heightened depression to the point of suicidal ideations would _prevent_ a batshit insane investigation from getting moreso, alas. I know a previous me would have probably killed myself because of all this, though, and frankly, I wondered if the government woudl put me in a position where I'd rather that due to their ability to well, be fascist at their own will. I let the lawyer know I'm feeling that way to leave breadcrumbs.

#### Friday

I figure'd it'd be best to make some emails lightly explaining the situation to the New York Times and Washington Post, so I made an email address I've since discarded explaining what I thought happened. I'm pretty sure I left my awareness of the political situation out and just said the company may have used a mob connection to intimidate me by cutting down the internet, which was a lie, including that this left me in a suicidal state. No response from the NYT, Wapo person repsonds saying they don't have the resources but gives some links to a digital forensics person and mental health services. I figure'd that'd be good enough to keep things at that. I, should have realized that would never be the case in retrospect. I think my heightened emotional state had something to do with it. Maybe I would have been better off leaving my therapist out of it, but, I couldn't come up with a good enough analogy for the situation. I'm no Tony Soprano after all.

#### Saturday

Call my parents to see if they'd be straight with me now that I had left, as an indicator of whether or not the "investigation" was still happening, at least to my parent's eyes. They immediately act ignorant of any knowledge of a greater situation, to which I kind of freak out at. I let my mom know, loudly, that she could probably resolve this situation if she told the truth. She starts yelling at me, and well, I wanted to break something. Normally I wouldn't, but I also figure'd the state may wanna check my cell phone, so I broke my phone just enough so the hard drive wouldn't break. I then threw it out in a McDonalds bag so it'd be easy to fish out of the garbage. I kind of regret this; I had to pay 300 dollars instead of being able to ship it back broken for a new one. Insurance plans, what can you do.

I make a silent pledge to stop checking the news. Fuck that shit if they're gonna try to put me on it on some fake bullshit. It's one that I held pretty strong to. I now only check the news if I really feel I need to. And mostly, I don't.
