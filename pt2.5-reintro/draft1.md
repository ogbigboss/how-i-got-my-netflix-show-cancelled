# Pt 2.5 - A flash to the future

### Somewhere near the end of July, in my bathroom, with the door open, with my ipad out, reading random things about computers or guitars until I worked up the swerve to masturabte to internet porn

_Jesus christ that thing is big. Where did it come from?_

So seeing the man I nicknamed "Tevas" again the other day was certainly something, even if he traded his namesakes for what looked like combat boots with splattered paint on them. I realized after that that I couldn't sell the laptop Liveramp gave me after quitting, out of fear of some immature prank being pulled with it.

_Why did it lift it's leg liek that on the way in? Is that thing... drunk?_

I decided that if I kept the laptop, I had to make up some response to the stunt near the park on Essex st. the other day, so I used it to make up a website called "bigbosswatch.com", to make fun of these people for being immature with audio surveillance in the workplace.

_I could kill it. It's probably going to go down the drain in my sink. I'm gonna not masturbate with my ipad now, that's for sure._

So I kind of knew I should expect _some_ kind of response, though I wasn't sure how tied into my building of 275 South St. my government street stalkers turned prank show wannabes were yet.

_But then I wouldn't be able to learn more about it._

I had a feeling it was a television prank show, and when I was sitting on my toilet reading stuff about computers or something on my iPad, thinking about masturbating, I saw a large roach about 2-4 inches crawl into my bathroom, I figure'd that at this point, the prank show people had taken over a few units and were tied into my building's maintenance crew - it's really hard to imagine anything else.

_It's definitely not from this area. I've lived here ten years, I'd of seen one like it by now. What I have probably won't kill it... but it may keep it around._

It was late July and near 90 degrees, plus the building has gardens outside which attract bugs of this kind if anything. A roach this size wouldn't want to be indoors, and 8 floors up in this weather. And it was of a type I just hadn't seen ever in this building - usually if cockroaches come inside, they're small. It's why I have small cockroach bait in my apartment, which, by the way, wasn't _that_ dirty at the time, in terms of things cockroaches like, which is food. Though the floors could have used a cleaning, that's for sure. Did I mention I'd live'd there for ten years?

_Wait... did that thing... just... look at me?_

When I saw it, I hiked up my pants, and got out of the bathroom. I got used to leaving the doors open - I knew I was being surveilled, though I hadn't figure'd it for a prank show. I got in the habit of keeping my door open while using the bathroom - for everything, yes, including masturbation - just so if anyone had to surveil me -- you know, for their job -- they'd have to make the choice between being pervs or being ashamed.

_Well... at least it seems to want the food..._

I went to my kitchen where I got the small cockroach bait. On the one hand it may kill the roach, on the other hand, it could just survive and feed off the stuff. When I got back I tossed the trap at the cockroach, who, well, I know this sounds weird -- but it just seemed to be _aware_ of my presence and _care_ about the fact that it shared the space with me... almost like it was familiar with humans?

~~I immediately put two and two together and realized the CIA must have micro motor technology, which can simulate the movement of cockroaches but are actually surveillance devices of a kind only the ingenious nature of the American military can construct~~

Here's what I was thinking, looking at the roach:

_Ok. So these guys probably put a roach in my apartment that was as big as they could find. My feeling based on how it's moving and the fact that it came straight to my bathroom is that they gave it a little whiskey or something to make it dehydrated and want to seek water, like in the toilet or maybe the sink, so I'd see it while on the toilet, something they know I do while I read my ipad or masturbate as I've ensured they could see, even without bathroom cameras, which I'd hope they're not using._

My heart raced a bit reader, I'll admit. Earlier in June I contacted former JAG Jesse Sommer, also a former colleague of mine who over a decade ago told me he was getting a JD MBA and joining the military specifically to serve as a JAG for a decade and go as far within the Democratic party electoral system as possible. At the time I thought well of that, because I thought well of him.

At this time, looking at this roach, who seemed to be looking at me, I realized two things.

_This roach definitely knows that I'm human. It was probably raised by someone who rents out roaches to Netflix shows or whatever, like an insect farmer or something._

and

_My former colleague Jesse Sommer is likely engaged me with this Netflix thing and if he asked people from the military to prank me into "respecting the federal government," well that would be fascism and I need to try and make a plan where Jesse can save face. That said, what if he wasn't lying about being a "special ops JAG" or wahtever that may be... guys from that section of the military could come from any branch and could be well, incredibly equipped to prank people. Also_ Burn Notice _as well as what I've read of former Navy SEAL team 6 and Red Cell leader Richard Marcinko aka "the Geek" makes it somewhat clear that Navy SEALs can be gross and flex about it. These people might take this really far. God damnit. I should have been an electrician, I should have never learned to make websites. Then I wouldn't never met Jesse Sommer. Here's to hoping they don't do me like they did Marcinko; I never served, it'd be kind of weird._

I started panicking and figure'd it'd be best to, if yet again, see if anyone would follow me in the streets. I'd deal with my new roommate in a few days.

I remember having one last thought as I left my bathroom to take a walk outside:

_These fuckers better not throw me in the East River either. Sure I act like a Cosmo Kramer from_ Seinfeld _, sure, but I'm not trying to take things that far._
