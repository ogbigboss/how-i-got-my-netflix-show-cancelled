# Pt 3.5 -- A flash to the future

> The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. â€“Psalms 118:22

### Early morning around 1AM, Sunday September the 25th outside 275 South St and under the FDR between the DSNY and Unlabled city parking areas

There were just a few times in this situation where I was so shocked that I developed tunnel vision.

_All I saw were the flames. Bright, like something out of television._

This was one of them.

I understand things got weird. They essentially were dangling one of my favorite celebrities that their political party has a good connection with, but in a way I found untoward. I didn't like the phrasing of being bucked like a bronco, even if they bribed my barber to say it.

_White, light yellow. Hot, and persistent._

So I pissed you off by rejecting something you were probably not offering, with that celebrity knowing, all from my apartment while under some sort of Reality TV show I didn't want to be on.

_The flames burn almost... like... chemicals?_

You tried clowning me in front of that celebrity when I saw them speak at the Y Uptown, and I made you look foolish for it, and then later that week, while being recorded for a Reality TV show I didn't consent to being on, I made it clear I wasn't going to sign paperwork to be on a show that made me look bad.

_Fire. Just Fire._

I get that pissed you off, I was trying to politely say you were committing crimes. I made it clear I knew you were just trying to cover up the federal investigations you shouldn't have put me on with a Netflix show, and that I wouldn't sign onto it, no matter who the Boss was.

But... after all that... why in god's name would you light a truck on fire outside my apartment?

_There's a truck on fire outside of my apartment. The way it's just staying on fire and with flames that seem that hot indicate they used some kinda chemicals like it's a Hollywood stunt. Typical. This is probably those idiots. I really hope this means this is over and not that it has anything to do with a deck of cards they think is magical._

It was another time where I wish I was psychic, but I was stupified. I just stared. And in my innocence - in thinking the actors positioned against me would one day, just, you know, stop and get a life -- I didn't take photos.

But I'm sure they exist _somewhere_. Video, even.

Personally, I dont like to play around with fire.
