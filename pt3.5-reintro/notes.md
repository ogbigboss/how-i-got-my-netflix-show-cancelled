# Pt 3.5 -- flash forward to the truck fire, introduce celebrities as legitimate concepts

1. Do a preview chapter, maybe perhaps right as the intro, of the truck fire incident in September later that year. Lightly mention getting the Boss involved -- should work well after describing the incident at the grocery store in late June, whcih should be one or two chapters before this section's intro -- in August, then you "rejecting the dangle", then seeing him and Jann Wenner and feeling like they were aware but it was still inadmissable and shady, _maybe_ make a lighter less Bernie mac version of the quote, but end in the general confusion of the truck fire incident. Make it like the pt0-intro thing. Maybe make it it's own introductory parts; flash forwards cuold be very interesting here considering many contextual overlaps were months apart (possibly seeing Uma Thurman vs. months later realizing she's playing Arianna Huffington, etc) -- get the Fiona from burn notice quote in there!
