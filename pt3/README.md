# Pt 3 - Post Liveramp, possibly up to the knife incident

1. Talk about Jesse Sommer + therapist having suspicious communications that felt off and oddly connected, though, with two separate overtones: the intent to exploit and the fear of being exploited, respectively
1. Catch up to the intro, get to the knife, and maybe just hint at the very end about realizing you had a big batch of bootleg DVDs and you were aware a streaming network like Netflix, particularly with their CEO's political leanings, being one of the most likely outcomes, and if you could prove it (this is pre Paula Patton), then you'd know what to do: catch up on some movies, apparently. Just a day in the life of a not spy.
1. OR, just stop at being followed in the streets to catch up to the intro. Give a warning that after that, things get weird, involve celebrities, accusations of terrorism, etc. Maybe a good cutoff point for a potential publisher to ask questions, while not having to get to the... more than probably publicly known parts. Exciting! Leave them wanting more!
1. HOWEVER, if you do go up to the knife incident, you could preface the walk to the police station with this internal monologue: _I love my mom, my dad, and my sister, and I really wish we could have resolved this whole situation in a peaceful way that didn't involve intimidation of my therapist via disabling our internet connections, but if my mom, dad, and sister are trying to play a game as I suspect they are, how can I best protect myself in this situation while ensuring that I don't let them get away with playing games when and where they shouldn't be. If I was wrong, I'd find out and pay some cost, but if it turns out I wasn't wrong, or things wouldn't have ever been this weird between me and my family, which, is saying something. I love them but I'm not going to lose for them if it means they have to win like this. I won't lose to them; but I do love them. So what if the government is involved? It's_ on.

1. After being followed in the park, and before the "knife incident", recall making a website that was and still is a joke called [https://bigbosswatch.com](bigbosswatch.com) as a way to "respond" to being followed in the streets as described in the intro. While making this website, that weird thing with the cockroach that was of a type not native to the area happened, make sure that you read it as a "retaliation" for starting to work on a joke website. Double check dates from notes. After launching the site, they did the thing with the internet connection downing on you and the therapist, leading to the "knife incident."
