# Pt 5 Chapter 1

"Bruce Springsteen" saved my life is probably something that's been said before, and will be said again, about the man's music.

If you had asked me before 2018, I'd of told you I grew up in Jersey, and was familiar with most of his hits, but was really more of a Tom Petty guy.

After 2020, I'd of told you I was a big fan -- I even named a video game after one of his songs, well, sort of, also the Bible I guess, but whatever.

(I probably would've been too shy to say I had been practicing singing three of his songs every night just about for the year of 2019, but I parenthetically digress).

After 2022, I can say with a somewhat clear mind that Bruce Sprintsteen might've saved my life - but not with something stupid like his rock n roll music.

Without Bruce Springsteen, I'm just not sure that Netflix along with the Biden Harris Administration, the KHive DNC, and very likely Barack Obama's Higher Grounds Productions would have been held accountable or in check, such to create a semblance of balance, and I may have suffered a far worse fate because of my leap of faith.

Anyway, thanks Boss. If someone talks shit about you I'm going to maybe get into a fight with them, and then I'm going to get profiled for it in the future where I'm accused of having delusions of being a timeless and legendary Rock n' Roll act. I hope the horn section I hallucinate can be anything close to what you had IRL.

#### Outline / events / chapters

#### 8/12 or 8/13 Best Buy to Guitar Center to Taco place to Legacy to Home Visit
- nts: check receipts on CC purchases at either GC, BB, also you stopped by legacy later, check email to confirm
- Talk about leaving that day, as you were waling out of the building your neighbor Mr. Gibbs says "whatup God" to me despite never talking to me "like that" in my ten years of acknowledging to him our shared presence as we pass in the hallways and streets. He seemed to be waiting for me to deliver that line. I was ranting to myself all week previously -- alone in my apartment with nearly every single electronic device that I own shut off on purpose to show the point that I wasn't communicating with anyone --  and one joke I kept making -- sorry Hollywood I wouldn't of been critical had I really thought this would go this far and whatever I'm just joking I just don't want to be anyone's art critic but I digress -- was about the LL Cool J / Omar Epps / Nia Long 1999 film _In Too Deep_, and how yes, I thought I would have made LL's character call himself anything but "God" as a nickname. You can watch the movie. Anyway I might've been making a bunch of jokes about that movie, considering I felt certain and was hoping that I at least got the NYPD to join in larger portions of whatever this was after the events of the previous week, and I felt like it was a movie that perhaps exagerrated a lot of things about the situation it was portraying. Mr. Gibbs saying this to me was a clear sign they knew, and were hinting to be kind about it with a joke. (nts: stop writing copy in notes)
- Talk about Guitar Center / Best Buy visits on either 8/12 or 8/13 Friday or Saturday, it's worth writing almost every single oddity since they were all humurous and indicated that yes, it was a reality tv show.
- Also, yes, somehow this guy at guitar center is hinting that he seems to know exactly the songs I cover in the privacy of my own apartment - VH Dance the night Away, other tells, and haven't necessarily even recorded myself on any device (probably? would this matter?), and yes, if I play even the rhythm to a certain Paul Simon song, and even if I drop the key a step and a half, playing just a hint of "She Loves Me Like a Rock" makes people run away laughing from me after obvviously having a scripted conversation about "obsession" that would be awkward even if it weren't Reality TV. Bro, just sell her a guitar for her kid. Anyway, describe every detail.
- It made it clear, especially at Best Buy, that you were being tailed and setup in an obvious way, many folks seemed more related to law enforcement than not judging by their visages, cadences, haircuts, and outfits, though some seemed to just be employed and in on the gag, and some -- particularly the GC guy -- seemed like an actor setup with information given that I was hinting at going to Guitar Center that whole week.
- Point out the guy who as you walked into Best Buy talked aloud about 55", whcih is a TV size. Recall how you played JJ Cale's Magnolia recentlyish, and thinking they were hinting at either something that was going to be on the TV's in Best Buy's famed "Magnolia" section, OR, that they were trying to hint you're being watched at through one or both of your own 55" TV's, something you had assumed had to be at least setup on your Bedroom TV (hey you pervs) since March given the events that occured in May/June/July and the previous week -- either way you purpsoefully avoided the bait and didn't go into that section
- Definitely talk about seeing the blu ray security cases in a box to be thrown out, how the main entrance was blocked, feeling suspicious of that being a setup or hint to me talking about working at Blockbuster and knowing how to break into those. Allude to _Watching the Detectives_ being a movie taht exists, possibly. Maybe use a _Cypher_ to do so. Ok, I'll stop being so awful, just call me _Codename: The Cleaner_. Ok I'll stop.
- DEFINITELY mention that you felt one guy who looked like a cop and felt was following you around a bit cracked up when he saw you cover up the Netflix gift certificates with Regal Theaters' gift certificates. I felt pretty certain Netflix was behind things at that point and decided not to press the point or topic more for some weeks to months feeling they had to be linked to a lesser subsidiary. I also knew the Obamas had _some_ kind of corporate relationship, though I didn't know the details, because I didn't care. But it was all in my head at the Best Buy, I just was hoping they'd all run away before I started Googling again. The truck fire in late september made me start googling again. (nts: really stop it with the copy)
