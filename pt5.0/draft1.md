# Pt 5 Chapter 1

"Bruce Springsteen" saved my life is probably something that's been said before, and will be said again, about the man's music.

If you had asked me before 2018, I'd of told you I grew up in Jersey, and was familiar with most of his hits, but was really more of a Tom Petty guy.

After 2020, I'd of told you I was a big fan -- I even named a video game after one of his songs, well, sort of, also the Bible I guess, but whatever.

(I probably would've been too shy to say I had been practicing singing three of his songs every night just about for the year of 2019, but I parenthetically digress).

After 2022, I can say with a somewhat clear mind that Bruce Sprintsteen might've saved my life - but not with something stupid like his rock n roll music.

Without Bruce Springsteen, I'm just not sure that Netflix along with the Biden Harris Administration, the KHive DNC, and very likely Barack Obama's Higher Grounds Productions would have been held accountable or in check, such to create a semblance of balance, and I may have suffered a far worse fate because of my leap of faith.

Anyway, thanks Boss. If someone talks shit about you I'm going to maybe get into a fight with them, and then I'm going to get profiled for it in the future where I'm accused of having delusions of being a timeless and legendary Rock n' Roll act. I hope the horn section I hallucinate can be anything close to what you had IRL.
