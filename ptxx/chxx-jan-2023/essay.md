### lots to talk about

### essay

_I literally wrote the below essay January 19th, apparently, though I could have misread the logs and it was before. Anyway._

Bigotry at it's root is divorced from morality, and words like sexism, racism, and economic classism are actually combinations of bigotry and moral assertions - divorced from the latter bigotry is revealed as a repetitive three step process eventually leading to a fourth and final step: violence!

Three steps:
1. _Someone's being stupid_ - Person or group A asserts something non or not entirely factual as fact, person or group B points out logical flaw at root or edges of person or group A's assertion.
2. _Reframing via social avoidance (cheap!)_ - Person or group A attempts to paint person or group B as incorrect without addressing entirely or completely what person or group B was pointing out.
3. _Reframing via economic and social resources (costly!)_ - Person or group A utilizes social, financial, or a combination of both and other resources to paint person or group B as incorrect or unreliable in various public spheres, forcing person or group B to work within constantly changing frames of an argument that has left person or group B's original point. This usually recurs into further arguments that repeat the cycle, a result whose calculus is simply a matter of person or group A's combined incorrect-ness along with accessible resources, including a willingness to spend / waste the time.

These three steps repeat until person or group A commits violence against OR successfully frames person or group B of violence, such to successfully perpetrate violence against person or group B, or justify another actor's violence against person or group B. Said third party violence historically has been physical, but includes imprisonment, loss of wealth, or indentured / non-consensual servitude (slavery!), and often within the legal framework of society itself if person or group A has the resources and representation among such levels of society.

When you _feel_ you are person or group B, there is only one truth:
1. You, supposed person or group B, cannot ever prove this due to everyone _feeling_ like the victim in situations of conflict in order to justify or cry out defense from violence.

Your only defense against being person or group A, as well as your best offense against person or group A (if you are indeed person or group B) is to remember and utilize when necessary the fact that you're not the stupid as fuck one in this situation, and the more it escalates, the more that is true of many things other than whatever started this situation - the truth is person or group A's stupidity will always be person or group B's greatest and only necessary weapon. 

However, if you are person or group A, your only way to "win" is to... stop being a bigot. Thusly, my main point is that bigotry isn't exemplified by moral issues - it's true framework is stupidity.

The only way to survive as person or group B is to force the three step cycle to repeat until person or group A has exhausted resources or motivation to expend said resources, while avoiding a pretext for them to get to step 4. It's tricky, but you got here by being smarter than someone else - if you are person or group B, that is.

If stupid is as stupid does, then stupid'd be best to just don't. Alas, it will.

But!, at least if you're person or group B, it may be best to think of these situations as games, because then, you're already winning.

All you have to know is that you are what you say you are, and that's just as true for when you say you're something you aren't.

So are you person or group A, or B?
