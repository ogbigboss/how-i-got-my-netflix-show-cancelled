# Potential remaining outline (in parts)

1. Early August 2022 - late september, start with the Boss and end with the Fire. Make Dancing in the Dark jokes as much as possible.
1. Flash forward: November 2022, maybe just include parts of the long ass tell all essay I wrote
1. Late September post truck fire to the week before Halloween
1. Flash forward: December 2022 and learning that Yuga labs was a company that was real, reference Lucy Liu movies helping
1. Last week of October to Early December 2022, end on making first video in dropbox series and pontificate on reasons as to why you needed a recorded fiction in case someone else told another fiction about you
1. Flash forward: First visit from people claiming to FBI officers; explain why you thought this was not real, lack of badge numbers, them not wanting to be videotaped, showing up at 8AM on a Saturday, being kind of rude, and explain your thought process and how you couldn't believe they were real and figure'd your bosses or Netflix were playing some joke on you, especially given that IMO the FBI wouldn't want to risk showing up to someone's door appaering politically biased unless the likelihood of a violent crime was indeed provably likely, etc
1. Early December 2022 to mid February 2022: The time I tried to record a version of events that could be plausible in order to make sure somoene else doesn't try to produce another version of events that is indeed not plausible but they can edit in anyway they like; largely because I think my story is better than Netflix's.
1. Flash forward: The getting arrested thing for the above
1. Mid February to late March 2022: Did I get the Democratic party to distract Netflix into allowing Putin to start a war, distract the crypto currency industry into base liquidity issues, distract their own senate majority by not ensuring the right to abortion, AND distract the tech banking sector into base liquidity issues? I mean... I am good looking, but god damn.
1. Flash forward: Probably me writing this shit right now
1. late March 2022 to Mid May 2022: These people have to be kidding right?
1. Flash forward: ???
1. June 2022
