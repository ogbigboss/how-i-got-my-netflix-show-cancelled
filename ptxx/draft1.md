# Pt xx -- Late September (possible intro)

> "Michael Westen: [narration] For a spy, there's no shame in retreat. When faced with a more powerful enemy you're trained to get out of the way and keep moving. It's not about running away or giving up. The goal of any retreat is to find the right place to marshal your resources and make a stand. Military history is filled with stories of small forces taking on larger ones. Whether it's David fighting Goliath or the French Resistance fighting the Nazis, the strategy is basically the same. You have to choose the right ground, deploy your resources carefully, and remember that the greatest weapon in any battle is surprise."

At this point, realizing I had to stay true to my character's word of what I said in early September, I believe I took `the_gg_move` one step further, and introduced recursion, in the seemingly infinite loop I am still in and hope to one day see an end to.

Recursion in computer programming is a deep topic; but at it's surface it's a function, which is like a pre planned play in a sport labeled by a name, but with one caveat -- it can call itself infinitely, until it is ready to reach what some call an exit clause.

```
function play_the_good_game
  try_and_get_my_harassers_to_realize_this_is_a_bad_idea_and_they_should_go_home_before_it_gets_worse

  if my_harassers_keep_harassing_me then
    play_the_good_game
  else if my_harassers_realize_its_legally_politically_socially_and_morally_better_to_stop then
    # nothing happens and the good game ends
  end
end
```

If you're wondering what a hashtag means, well, in many programming languages it's something called a comment. It doesn't actually do anything save for give programmers a chance to write things other than code, such to explain the code they're writing.

So when that line says nothing happens and the good game ends... that's what it means.

Nothing happens. In a code review profesionally, someone would probably point that out and say you could even get rid of two lines of code, since nothing at all happens in that case. You don't need the word `morally` to even be in the function, that way.

Anyway, September in the rain. Writing this in June 2023, some 9 months later, I'm still in this loop somehow. Alas.

#### From Arthur comes Batman, realizing these people thought you were bluffing, singing and howling on Wall st pt I

- Batman R.I.P. - I was thinking of it since at least July to be honest in this situation. I was glad to finally take it out so I could remember the word "Apophenia", as well as that other quote about Joker rooting on the Batman's predictable next steps.
- "I know what they're scared of" - tehcnically I didn't, I thought it was strippers, they were probably scared of the Anonymous articles running Yuga Labs at the time of the last week of September, which considering the truck fire's allusions to KKK behavior, was... hilarious, to me, a sicko. I didn't learn about those articles til January in 2023 though, I believe.

1. Flash forward: December 2022 and learning that Yuga labs was a company that was real, reference Lucy Liu movies helping
1. Last week of October to Early December 2022, end on making first video in dropbox series and pontificate on reasons as to why you needed a recorded fiction in case someone else told another fiction about you
1. Flash forward: First visit from people claiming to FBI officers; explain why you thought this was not real, lack of badge numbers, them not wanting to be videotaped, showing up at 8AM on a Saturday, being kind of rude, and explain your thought process and how you couldn't believe they were real and figure'd your bosses or Netflix were playing some joke on you, especially given that IMO the FBI wouldn't want to risk showing up to someone's door appaering politically biased unless the likelihood of a violent crime was indeed provably likely, etc
1. Early December 2022 to mid February 2023: The time I tried to record a version of events that could be plausible in order to make sure somoene else doesn't try to produce another version of events that is indeed not plausible but they can edit in anyway they like; largely because I think my story is better than Netflix's.


# Pt xx -- Early December Possible Intro

In early December 2022, my best take on my then situation was this.

_My entire apartment and large portions of the building I live in are being surveilled via at least several devices via "hacks" and also bugs planted by the building management in tandem with either the NYPD, Netflix, or both; they have video and audio.__

_This is for a reality TV show originally meant to defame me and possibly falsely incriminate me._

_There are two groups surveilling me and using this surveillance in various ways. One seeks to defame me at least, another seeks to defend me also at least.__

_This has been going on since July 2022 and has escalated in various ways._

_The group seeking to defame me has already or will at some point doctor their footage, and spread it to a wider audience to portray me in an edited fashion. They also may likely employ voice overs to make it seem like I say things that I'm not._

_This will take away the voice of those seeking to defend me; a larger audience will have to realize one is lying. The group seeking to defame likely knows this but has more clout than my defenders._

_How can I help defend myself while helping those that are already defending me in this bizzaro situation?_

I had a fancy-ish video camera setup to my desktop PC for Twitch streaming. I rarely before December 2022 hit the "record" button.

I had to do something to defend myself, and if they would use video and audio against me, then fair's fair.

I started hitting the record button sometime in early December (nts: possibly late Novemeber, check).

1. Flash forward: The getting arrested thing for the above
1. Mid February to late March 2023: Did I get the Democratic party to distract Netflix into allowing Putin to start a war, distract the crypto currency industry into base liquidity issues, distract their own senate majority by not ensuring the right to abortion, AND distract the tech banking sector into base liquidity issues? I mean... I am good looking, but god damn.
1. Flash forward: Probably me writing this shit right now
1. late March 2023 to Mid May 2023: These people have to be kidding right? The Connells, the clampdown, and the TV news
1. Flash forward: ???
1. June 2023
